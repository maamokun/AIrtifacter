I’m not so good at remembering…\n\nPreface\n\nInarguably the cutest playable character in Genshin Impact, Klee was the headline act of the second limited-time Event Banner from version 1.0. With a mixture of adorableness and Genshin’s arguable peak popularity in Genshin’s 1st year, Klee was unofficially recorded with the Highest Single Day iOS Sales in China, 2nd Highest Overall Banner iOS Sales in China, 2nd Highest Overall Banner iOS + Android Sales in Japan. This year there have been a few banners which have matched and eclipsed Klee’s initial run, but her initial dominance made its mark. Whilst Klee may not be the most popular choice for late-game content, well practiced players are easily able to blow through late-game content. Her personal gameplay is very unique and skill expressive; fluent veterans will squeeze out tons of utility and mileage from her. Overall, Klee is a bundle of joy both as a character and in combat, and investing into her will bring you happiness. *Source: CN iOS sales via chandashi.com JP iOS + Android sales via game-i.daa.jp credit aljini10 for work https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/o0qvrq/banner_sales_as_of_june_14th/\n\nStrengths and Weaknesses\n\nKlee’s Strengths\n\nPlay to these strengths.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"WiJcb+cSmiQCO6DhcBZqko38Db4ypLMnwHhFJUqpeeI="},"2d67a96c-235c-436d-9200-cd804c87e6a8":{"id_":"2d67a96c-235c-436d-9200-cd804c87e6a8","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"edfaf7db-13fb-40dd-ad63-32271a690df9","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"WiJcb+cSmiQCO6DhcBZqko38Db4ypLMnwHhFJUqpeeI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1770c6bc-4b00-49e4-a4ca-de5d448d61ff","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"4fNxpjaPXGe26MZhCuM8FNU2bOqj7N3yC8HytdhPjpg="}},"text":"Playstyle\n\nVery skill expressive character with tons of movement and animation cancels. Her “strongest combo” damage wise, N1C, is also the simplest to play, allowing you to focus on this skill expression. Charged Attacks have very high poise damage allowing you to juggle/stunlock enemies. Stunlocked enemies are unable to attack Klee therefore shields aren’t needed. Elemental Skill and Burst snapshots buffs. Elemental Skill can be used for off-field damage. Team Building\n\nHigh synergy with Genshin Impact’s most popular supports. Provides great teamwide Energy generation through her A4 Talent and Elemental Skill. Entire kit has AoE damage and works even better with grouping. Doesn’t need Xingqiu. High Pyro application to enable Reactions from teammates. Build\n\nHas several viable artifact options so easy to build. Viable F2P weapon options. R5 Widsith is a 4* Catalyst and has a higher damage ceiling than any 5* Catalyst, on top of being “easier” to acquire. Klee’s Weaknesses\n\nConsiderations you may need to take. Playstyle\n\nKit identity suggests she was designed to excel in Co-Op. Mobile players and players of lesser skill may find her tricky to play. Players who cannot maintain the offense may feel uncomfortable without a shield. Elemental Burst has the smallest AoE in her kit, enemies need to be well grouped/consolidated. Team Building\n\nStrongest teams use some of the game’s most popular supports, can make it hard to field a second team. Bennett can be considered essential. Klee is not really a hypercarry, so investment in the entire team is recommended. Build\n\nMarechaussee Hunter is a huge damage boost but requires Furina in teams to fully utilise. Weapons with ramp-up buffs like Lost Prayer and Memory of Dust will not scale with her entire kit. 5* Catalysts have lackluster passives and are mainly used as stat sticks. The better Catalysts require Furina’s HP drain for consistent passive activation.

Resultantly, in combat she can break Geo shields and constructs quickly, and shatter freeze. Outside of combat she can mine ores. If aiming to play optimally to any degree, Klee’s full 3-hit Normal Attack combo should never be used in any circumstance. Due to a mixture of talent scaling and slow speed, both her 2nd and 3rd hits are objectively weaker than just repeating her 1st hit over & over with animation cancels, known as Machine Gun. The guide will touch on later how to achieve this. Though understand that ultimately even situations which warrant Machine Gun spamming are rare due to her high Charged Attack damage, which you almost always want to weave into your combos instead. Note, when Normal Attacks deal DMG, Klee has a 50% chance to obtain an Explosive Spark, via her 1st Ascension Passive, Pounding Surprise. Her Normal Attacks are mainly single-target with poor AoE. These attacks (and her Charged Attacks) are projectile based, compared to most other Catalyst users which are hitscan, meaning due to its lobbing animation it does give her a limited range. Charged Attack\n\nConsumes 50 Stamina normally, and 0 Stamina whilst under the effects of Pounding Surprise. One of the pillars of Klee’s kit, the simplest (and overall strongest) way to weave this into gameplay is to simply double-click. Klee will do the 1st hit of her Normal Attack and quickly follow this up with a Charged Attack, denoted as N1C. Spamming this double-click in rhythm provides Klee with her highest Talent% combo, though even with Pounding Surprise procs, this will deplete her Stamina rapidly. However, it is possible to quickly queue a second Charge Attack and get two Charge Attacks benefiting from a single Explosive Spark proc, increasing both damage output and consuming less stamina. For example, after using her Skill (and gaining a Explosive Spark), doing N1C dash C can consume just the stamina required from the dash. Example (timestamp 0:15). Klee’s Charged Attack is very noticable in that it has a high stagger potential. She will often break enemies’ poise and send them flying. This also serves as a defensive function.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"4fNxpjaPXGe26MZhCuM8FNU2bOqj7N3yC8HytdhPjpg="},"f912dbbd-5965-4e3a-9b09-f5afe26329e4":{"id_":"f912dbbd-5965-4e3a-9b09-f5afe26329e4","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1770c6bc-4b00-49e4-a4ca-de5d448d61ff","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"4fNxpjaPXGe26MZhCuM8FNU2bOqj7N3yC8HytdhPjpg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"607d27ac-58c3-43e4-aab6-d713b48b7daf","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"I6LdWrWpu1NFCxISLlmjPxvpjf1tZB5O4Pm5WsCesUA="}},"text":"This also serves as a defensive function. This ability can also be used in conjunction with Venti’s Elemental Burst, where her Charged Attack can throw even the largest enemies in the air and make them locked into Venti’s burst. This knockback direction is independent of an enemy’s position within the hitbox, meaning the Charged Attack does not diverge groups of enemies. The hitbox and overall range for her Charged Attack is much larger than one would assume, both horizontally and vertically. Practical application of this means this hits enemies inside Venti’s burst, even if they are fully staggered and lifted. It also forms a large part of her AoE damage coverage. Plunge Attack\n\nLike other Catalyst users, her Plunge Attack is Elemental. However it is un-notable and irrelevant for 99% of gameplay. This is not considered a heavy attack. Elemental Skill\n\nElemental Skill | Jumpy Dumpty\n\nKlee throws Jumpy Dumpty which bounces 3 times, with sizable AoE damage potential with each bounce. After this, the bomb splits into 8 mines, which will set off if an enemy comes into its small range. Hitting an enemy will produce 4 Pyro Elemental Particles, though each usage of the Skill can only produce this once. With two charges, this provides heavy front-loaded damage but with a long 20 second cooldown, allowing Klee to potentially terminate an enemy if there’s enough damage to bypass the following cooldown issue. When using the two charges in succession, the mines of the first one will explode early to make way. Whilst hitting an enemy with either the initial Jumpy Dumpty damage or the following mines, Klee has a 50% chance to obtain an Explosive Spark via her 1st Ascension Passive—Pounding Surprise. Therefore, one can weave in charge attack combos in between Jumpy Dumpty charge uses, but it is not recommended. The initial Jumpy Dumpty hits have a fair amount of AoE—both horizontal and vertical—and will hit enemies caught in Venti’s burst for example. Kazuha’s suction also keeps Jumpy Dumpty pulled in whilst it is active. As for the mines, Sucrose’s, Kazuha’s, Anemo Traveler’s, and Jean’s suction abilities will suck in these mines, allowing more damage opportunities. However, none of Venti’s skills will move these mines.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"SLc0Be3xUfBIdkiUiYb+8aICP4UBlGGTA7BEcU1IIE8="},"607d27ac-58c3-43e4-aab6-d713b48b7daf":{"id_":"607d27ac-58c3-43e4-aab6-d713b48b7daf","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f912dbbd-5965-4e3a-9b09-f5afe26329e4","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"SLc0Be3xUfBIdkiUiYb+8aICP4UBlGGTA7BEcU1IIE8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"94fb13bb-1acf-413c-8ab7-93cc42e48a29","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"6vP8FZJadoFznMzvkhbDWFgGwhckL3nLvHkoKi2oPw0="}},"text":"However, none of Venti’s skills will move these mines. This is acknowledged by Mihoyo as not a bug but a design decision. Each mine has its own ICD on Pyro application; however, these mines share an ICD on Pyro application with her Normal Attacks. Meaning, they can both steal reactions and allow Klee to do more reactions due to increased amounts of attacks. See the ICD Theory page for more in-depth info. If using 4pc Crimson Witch or Kagura’s Verity Pro Tip: By immediately cancelling her Skill with her Burst (Press E then Q really fast), before Jumpy Dumpty even gets thrown or goes on CD, the game will consider a Skill to have been casted while Klee still has the Skill charge left. Example: E > Press Q Fast > E > E\n\nKlee will gain one more stack than what is normally possible from both 4pc Crimson Witch passive and Kagura’s Verity passive, for a total of 3 stacks with 2 succesful Skill casts. (Update: A variation of this bug has been patched as of Version 2.6) Note: This is a separate mechanic to cancelling her Skill with her Burst just after Jumpy Dumpty is thrown, an animation cancel used to cut down on Klee’s Skill animation. This will be covered in the Animation Cancels section. Elemental Burst\n\nElemental Burst | Sparks ‘n’ Splash\n\nFor 10 seconds, summons groups of projectile hits every 2 seconds which home in on nearby enemies. It deals damage in 6 waves, and on each wave, there is a 35% chance for 3 hits to occur, 50% chance for 4 hits to occur, and 15% chance for 5 hits to occur. Make sure to hold a direction when casting (WASD key or D-Pad), the Burst animation lockout will finish roughly 0.5s quicker when Klee moves. If you ever notice she is frozen for a bit after using her Burst, it’s probably due to not doing this. If you switch out within 10 seconds, the Burst effects end and will not continue. Therefore, it is encouraged to use her Burst as soon as she swaps in (or after Normal/Charged attacks if needed to buff her with specific weapon conditions).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"I6LdWrWpu1NFCxISLlmjPxvpjf1tZB5O4Pm5WsCesUA="},"94fb13bb-1acf-413c-8ab7-93cc42e48a29":{"id_":"94fb13bb-1acf-413c-8ab7-93cc42e48a29","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"607d27ac-58c3-43e4-aab6-d713b48b7daf","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"I6LdWrWpu1NFCxISLlmjPxvpjf1tZB5O4Pm5WsCesUA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d426b08f-ca99-42fe-95ef-3d1b96a23966","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"4aa8dGi8NDDn6xouJfFgavL/APQVTxCRenciHTgZCJo="}},"text":"Klee’s attributes are snapshotted on cast, meaning buffs like Bennett’s Elemental Burst, Noblesse Oblige 4pc Set Bonus, Instructor 4pc Set Bonus, etc. will increase the damage of Sparks ‘n’ Splash for the whole duration as long as they were present when the Elemental Burst was casted. Ascension 1 Passive\n\nAscension 1 Passive | Pounding Surprise\n\nWhen Jumpy Dumpty (both initial bounces and the following mines) and Normal Attacks deal DMG, Klee has a 50% chance to obtain an Explosive Spark. This Explosive Spark is consumed by the next Charged Attack, which costs no Stamina and deals 50% increased DMG. Whilst Klee is using this Explosive Spark, she has increased interruption resistance. This will prevent her from being staggered. This spark can only be generated every 4 seconds, and both methods of obtaining it share this cooldown.

However in Vaporize carry teams, this brings more inconsistency to her Vaporize% with Xingqiu as a support, although minimal if Xingqiu has Constellation 6. Therefore it can be either a DPS loss or gain depending on where these procs do occur. This additional damage is considered as Elemental Burst damage, therefore the Noblesse Oblige 2pc Set Bonus boosts this, and additionally Solar Pearl’s passive both boosts this and its own application counts as a condition to boost her Normal Attack damage too.

As an on-field DPS, this is also a strict DPS increase when triggered shortly before the Burst expiration, and allows more versatility as previously she loses damage when switching early.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"4aa8dGi8NDDn6xouJfFgavL/APQVTxCRenciHTgZCJo="},"00330c73-0939-4d5c-9d2a-584319d6b69b":{"id_":"00330c73-0939-4d5c-9d2a-584319d6b69b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d426b08f-ca99-42fe-95ef-3d1b96a23966","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"4aa8dGi8NDDn6xouJfFgavL/APQVTxCRenciHTgZCJo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f890eebe-ac9c-4e29-8913-81fcf6048564","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"Qq8o7EFV3fzeMJeryqVf2riUS/RdM2bg5ruqG8RjWIs="}},"text":"This Burst has a higher-than-normal Elemental application gauge at 2B.

Learning How To Control And Enhance Klee\n\nRelative to other characters in Genshin Impact, Klee is a high ceiling character with a learning curve. Learning the basics can go a long way to improving the feel of Klee gameplay. Klee is at a disadvantage if you are unable to break her free of her base shackles. Her default, uninterrupted Normal Attack combos are slow and clunky. Klee also deals a lot of her damage through strong but slow charge attacks. She is also naturally easily staggered, so getting hit in a slow animation can send this kid flying. When played badly, things can get ugly. On the flipside, almost everything in her kit can be animation cancelled, meaning these slow individual attacks can be shortened and chained together to paste overall smoother and higher damage ceiling combos. Klee is also uniquely able to move in between combos, which is a crucial time save and optimisation due to her explosions often throwing even the biggest enemies all over the place.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"u5bXE7Z2gZMeP0huGuMSsNM4Y/J6cI0yBukcfSWQ+Bw="},"f890eebe-ac9c-4e29-8913-81fcf6048564":{"id_":"f890eebe-ac9c-4e29-8913-81fcf6048564","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"00330c73-0939-4d5c-9d2a-584319d6b69b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"u5bXE7Z2gZMeP0huGuMSsNM4Y/J6cI0yBukcfSWQ+Bw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"cffe2f60-835b-4434-a40a-f709430e7d69","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"vWV7qaR5XdGmzZnj575d5wdBO4TqQLvBVKObLMYWW+Y="}},"text":"Learning when to mix in dash cancels, jump cancels, or even when to just stay put makes a huge difference. But.. you don’t need to be a FGC pro player in order to play Klee. In fact, N1C combos are simple and also the most commonly used, even when it comes to speedrunning. Playing Klee to a high level does not need to be complex. Note: Klee has numerous different cancels, many of which are not covered in this guide. What is covered below are cancels you should learn and will be doing for the majority of your Klee gameplay. These are the most relevant and useful. Learning Animation Cancels\n\nThe examples below show common animation cancelling strategies and timing. You can use movement; walking, jumping, or dashing to cancel animations with the appropriate timing. Normal Attack\n\nAnimation cancelling Klee’s basic attack is also known as “Machine Gun”. Hold a directional key while clicking attack. The timing is precise. However, a common misconception is players thinking they really need to learn Machine Gun and frequently utilise it in their gameplay. As mentioned earlier, situations which warrant Machine Gun spamming are rare due to her high Charge Attack damage, which you almost always want to weave into your combos instead. Still, when you have ran out of stamina for example, using Machine Gun can be an effective playstyle adjustment. Attack (Talent Level 6) Frames Talent%/s Default 3 Hit Combo 148 127 Machine Gun 36 168\n\nAround a 32% DPS increase (depending on timing). Use it! Dash Cancels\n\nJump Cancels\n\nMoving whilst attacking is more relevant than purely using Machine Gun. You can do this either with dashing or jumping between attacks. Dashing is both slightly faster and safer due to i-frames, but has the heavily downside of depleting your stamina reserve, which is crippling for Klee in most cases. Jump cancelling can used, though as well as being slightly slower, is dangerous to use in practice due to having no resistance to interruption in the air. N1C/N2C\n\nN1C: Normal to Charged Attack N2C: Machine Gun x2 to Charged Attack (higher chance of acquiring an Explosive Spark)\n\nCharged Attacks are ideally cancelled by Normal Attacks, which require you to click again immediately after the laser fires.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Qq8o7EFV3fzeMJeryqVf2riUS/RdM2bg5ruqG8RjWIs="},"cffe2f60-835b-4434-a40a-f709430e7d69":{"id_":"cffe2f60-835b-4434-a40a-f709430e7d69","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f890eebe-ac9c-4e29-8913-81fcf6048564","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"Qq8o7EFV3fzeMJeryqVf2riUS/RdM2bg5ruqG8RjWIs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f73b3e8b-0aa9-426c-bba9-f14c0f5cbcc7","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"iJciU/fe6lD+uzGKZDcShXePuvNPvOXmMfM3potmRxs="}},"text":"Simply, you double-click in rhythm. You can also jump or dash in between double-clicks if you need to move. Again, dash cancelling has the highest DPS and survivability, but when combined with constant Charged Attacks, Klee’s Stamina reserve rapidly depletes. N2C is used in several situations: to get more consistent sparks, to slow down Stamina depletion rates, and also to increase reaction rates in certain Vaporize teams. FAQ: When should I use N1C vs N2C? Staying still or dash canceling have the highest DPS. Staying still can also have resistance to interruption  when using an Explosive Spark. Dashing gives extra i-frame survivability in exchange for stamina. Jumping is slower than both, as well as lacking any resistance to interruption. Double Spark Tech\n\nIt is possible to quickly queue a second Charge Attack and get two Charge Attacks benefiting from a single Explosive Spark proc, increasing both damage output and consuming less stamina. For example, after using her Skill (and gaining a Explosive Spark), doing N1C dash C can consume just the stamina required from the dash. Example (timestamp 0:15).

Spam N1C:\n\nGenerally for maximum damage per second. When you have high amounts of Stamina available. To initially break an enemy’s poise the fastest and start the technique of juggling. Spam N2C:\n\nTo conserve Stamina due to it applying more Pounding Surprise bonuses per Charged Attack. For more consistency in keeping enemies permanently juggled/stunlocked. Alternate between them:\n\nWhen played with Xingqiu to consistently vaporize her Charged Attacks. For a middle ground of high DPS and Stamina conservation. Elemental Burst\n\nKlee’s Sparks ‘n’ Splash can be used to cancel any animation. It just needs to be casted at the right time, before another attack is fully released. It is important to find the correct timing, as cancelling the Jumpy Dumpty animation too early will actually stop that attack from happening.

Cancelling Jumpy Dumpty after it leaves Klee’s hands, in order to save time on the animation. Cancelling Jumpy Dumpty before it even appears, i.e. pressing Burst very fast. This doesn’t actually use Jumpy Dumpty and the charge remains, however the game still registers this as a use. The reason for this is to gain an extra passive stack on either 4pc Crimson Witch or Kagura’s Verity. Juggling/Stunlocking Enemies\n\nThe best defence is a good offence! Klee’s Charged Attacks are very useful for breaking enemies poise, and maintaining offence through consistent Charged Attacks can allow her to juggle most enemies and keep them stunlocked. Becoming proficient in these techniques is key to taking Klee further beyond, and can enable you to trivialise many fights. In fact, mastering juggling is what enables many players to solo the Spiral Abyss using only Klee. Once enemies’ poise is broken, the recommended way to keep them juggled is with N2CJ or N1CJ. This both reduces Stamina expenditure and allows Klee to follow enemies and stay on top of things. The key is consistent Charged Attacks to prevent enemies from getting a chance to recover. Klee can juggle Fatui and prevent them from even getting a shield up. Klee stunlocking and completely dismantling the big bad wolves in Floor 12 of the Abyss. EZ\n\nAs mentioned earlier, these juggled enemies can be thrown into Venti’s Vortex even if they are originally too heavy for it. This is a huge benefit to the two characters’ synergy by giving you multiple layers of grouping and crowd control. Jumpy Dumpty Usage And Being Strategic With It\n\nAs covered in the initial Talents section, Klee’s Elemental Skill Jumpy Dumpty starts with two initial charges, and therefore from the start of combat one can use these two however and whenever to suit the situation. Its drawback being, each charge (excluding cooldown reduction shenanigans) will take 20 seconds per use to reload. Essentially, this means that the 1st rotations will have 2 Jumpy Dumpty uses (and therefore from the start of every Abyss chamber) with each following rotation only typically having access to 1*.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"iJciU/fe6lD+uzGKZDcShXePuvNPvOXmMfM3potmRxs="},"90a30d35-9ca2-40a0-90ca-ccdb2b96a51f":{"id_":"90a30d35-9ca2-40a0-90ca-ccdb2b96a51f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f73b3e8b-0aa9-426c-bba9-f14c0f5cbcc7","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"iJciU/fe6lD+uzGKZDcShXePuvNPvOXmMfM3potmRxs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3e0495ed-b741-48cd-b5c1-7f885ac05822","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"vt2ZM7XOMfJ/eqDu5JJUUr3A+uNcqC2KZG59rZ9KGEI="}},"text":"This gives a strategic element to how one can take advantage of this. *Some niche teams can end up rotating faster than 20s, which can make them awkwardly desync with Jumpy Dumpty’s cooldown. Adjust as needed\n\nHere are 2 popular ways you can use this:\n\nUsing the 1st charge to battery the team (if using The Widsith, Klee needs to already be in the 1st team slot position). Most notably in Mono Pyro compositions, rotations can be led with Jumpy Dumpty, instead of something else to apply initial Pyro aura application onto enemies. This is typically followed up with a teammate’s Swirl for early buffs, debuffs and potential grouping. This initial usage has two benefits. – Providing a surge of Pyro Elemental Particles to help battery up the team’s Elemental Bursts between chambers. This smoothes out gameplay and lessens concerns of finishing chambers without Bursts being fully charged up. – Although lacking many buffs compared to being used later in rotations during Klee’s damage window, Jumpy Dumpty and the ensuing mines, especially in conjunction with Kazuha’s Elemental Skill for suction, still typically would produce higher upfront damage than whatever you would typically use for initial Pyro application. The second Jumpy Dumpty can be used later in Klee’s main damage window as normal, after the team has fully set up. Using both charges consecutively during Klee’s main on-field damage window. Unlike many other carries in Genshin Impact, she doesn’t have a “nuke” option. This generally gives these other characters big advantages not just in speedrunning, but importantly, frontloaded damage is inherently optimal against HP-thresholded enemies and fights with limited damage windows. In fact, dealing similar amounts of total damage but faster is ideal as downtime doesn’t matter once all the opponents are cleared. Well Klee doesn’t have this single instance of nuke damage, but she does have something. When using two charges in succession, the mines of the first will explode early to make way. This means in a period of a few seconds, you can potentially see 6 Jumpy Dumpty bounces, 16 mine explosions, 5 Burst lasers, as well as any Normal and Charged Attack uses, all fully buffed and highly concentrated.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"zhKqYbQVRwCbj/caNflPvQc4eVpFOhwm6CLGfUf3q2A="},"3e0495ed-b741-48cd-b5c1-7f885ac05822":{"id_":"3e0495ed-b741-48cd-b5c1-7f885ac05822","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"90a30d35-9ca2-40a0-90ca-ccdb2b96a51f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"zhKqYbQVRwCbj/caNflPvQc4eVpFOhwm6CLGfUf3q2A="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"abadaef9-e0f2-488d-8263-6ec5b021d9a3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"nHrlVxUU/e77YlMLM5fYuORpIDJ/6EmwwkwZBoZ7nkY="}},"text":"Now in conjunction with the rest of the team’s off-field attacks, like Xiangling’s Guoba and Pyronado, Kazuha’s field and swirls, it’s not far off from a “nuke”. Talent Priority\n\nThe value of Klee’s Charged Attacks vary a lot in terms of her overall share of damage, depending on teams compositions and field time. Longer field time = more overall damage from Charged Attacks, especially when adding Amplifying Reactions. Regardless she still has considerable damage from both her Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst, especially in popular Mono Pyro teams. For high level players at endgame, it can be argued that her Skill is in fact her most powerful Talent. For example, in the Mono Pyro team with Bennett, Kazuha, and Xiangling, her damage distribution against 1 enemy can be calculated to be as follows: 1st rotation: 35% NA/CA, 40% Skill, 25% Burst. Consecutive rotations: 46% NA/CA, 24% Skill, 30% Burst. Importantly, note that these distributions are assuming fully completed rotations. The faster enemies are defeated, the more relevant her Skill is, due to the ability to rapidly dump out its damage share. No matter which way you cut it, it’s hard to dub Klee a Charged Attack focused character like popular belief may mistakenly suggest. Therefore, talent priorities are recommended:\n\nNormal Attack = Elemental Skill > Elemental Burst Crown Normal Attack and/or Elemental Skill if interested\n\nIf constellations are unlocked, recommendations don’t change unless C4 is obtained and Klee is transitioned to usage only as a support, in which case Normal Attack leveling can stop and focus should be shifted to just the Elemental Skill.

When played correctly, it is so far ahead of its contemporaries even considering downtime. Do not be fooled by the 10s on, 20s off impression. Since Klee front loads her Jumpy Dumpties and snapshots her Burst when she switches in, she generally isn’t wanting to be on the field much longer than 10 seconds anyway. If you can clear the content in this one rotation, then fantastic, The Widsith at R5 even significantly outperforms 5* weapons. If you can’t, then no buff will be obtained for the second rotation. But the buffs will be back for the 3rd duration, so as you can see this huge buff can have uptime ranging from 100% to 50% to 66%. Again to stress, The Widsith still dominates factoring in the downtime. r1 > r5 is approximately a 10% increase in Klee’s total damage. The caveats are that aside from Vaporize compositions with Klee carrying, other teams do not benefit from the EM buff, denoted ingame as ♪♬. This will occur 33% of the time, and requires plowing through or restarting a chamber. Dodoco Tales Obtained for free at R5 in version 1.6, alongside her rerun, Dodoco Tales is a very viable weapon. It is overall much weaker than The Widsith, but regardless trumps most 4* weapons. In a fully buffed team this weapon gets significantly weaker due to ATK and DMG Bonus saturation. This weapon’s strengths are its significant boost to Klee’s Charged Attacks, so if one were to extend Klee’s damage windows playing expressively, it is possible to close the gap with The Widsith. For this playstyle, you will want to start her field time with an N1C before using her Elemental Skill cancelled into her Burst. This is needed in order to snapshot the weapon passive’s buffs correctly. This is noticeably annoying and fairly counterintuitive.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"wFJOXBhvCJEmbCdCz6F2qPzGiGcsHb0uOtahKJb6r8A="},"3e989d69-b127-4004-b108-759c970bd5a3":{"id_":"3e989d69-b127-4004-b108-759c970bd5a3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"159e56b8-068d-4401-b02b-70b90728caa5","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"wFJOXBhvCJEmbCdCz6F2qPzGiGcsHb0uOtahKJb6r8A="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"cfef012e-2ec5-440e-98c6-b9609944ab29","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"P0gKib8pTZzeWwHeRaPhloy3WPGVKJqFR65o9fdwnCw="}},"text":"This is noticeably annoying and fairly counterintuitive. However for more tight rotations, noticeably with Mono Pyro’s quickswap-eqsue style, it’s not really worth delaying her Skill and Burst; the small ATK% overall buff to both does not outweigh having her Burst active longer for the extra proc. Also note the Charged Attack that initially applies the ATK% boost does not get it applied onto itself. Flowing Purity Probably the best F2P guaranteed, craftable 4* option and can perform well in Furina teams. The Bond of Life passive requires Klee to be played alongside a healer to be utilised fully, although due to Klee’s relatively low max HP it’s still easy for even Bennett to fully heal her. If using this, refining to max is highly recommended. However, if a player can get ahold of even 1 copy of The Widsith, that would be stronger as far as 4* weapon options goes. Solar Pearl Obtained via Battle Pass, Solar Pearl is also amongst Klee’s top tier 4* weapons. Alongside its strength in damage, the Crit Rate boost also synergises with her Ascension 4 Passive, so you will see a slight increase in team energy gain.The drawback is pretty clear. It’s passive boosts everything apart from Charged Attacks. That’s not to say Klee’s Charged Attacks are weak with this weapon, rather it could’ve been a lot better. Solar Pearl also requires a slight change in playstyle in order to properly buff all her damage sources. At minimum you must start Klee’s field time with a Normal Attack. It is recommended to animation this Normal Attack into a Jumpy Dumpty and cancel that into her Elemental Burst. Sacrificial Fragments For use in Burgeon teams. Jumpy Dumpty generates a lot of Energy particles, provides Off-Field Pyro application, and its damage is a very big part of Klee’s kit. To balance it, the Skill cooldown is a very high 20s. Therefore, Sacrificial Fragments giving her increased Skill uses always had potential. Unfortunately until recently, Klee never really had teams or playstyles where she would benefit from the EM substat to fully utilise this weapon.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ScJgG1ZFjzYZVVrCQtQpUVww0A2gCSWdSS8zzgF5VWM="},"cfef012e-2ec5-440e-98c6-b9609944ab29":{"id_":"cfef012e-2ec5-440e-98c6-b9609944ab29","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3e989d69-b127-4004-b108-759c970bd5a3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"ScJgG1ZFjzYZVVrCQtQpUVww0A2gCSWdSS8zzgF5VWM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"bd32482d-6bba-4b4b-9803-a655ce7f69cb","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"fVSCiROenI9o5PoNAtEMdmX+7h34oJMT0cPgN7SYqS8="}},"text":"Until now… (since Klee builds full EM in Burgeon teams, unfortunately the damage from Jumpy Dumpty doesn’t matter)\n\n5* Weapons\n\nTome of the Eternal Flow/Cashflow Supervision These weapons are very similar and both require Klee to be played in Furina teams, and subsequently allow Klee have access to consistent HP decreases and increases, to be used to full effect. In those teams these weapons create a solid gap between themselves and alternative 5* options, and therefore become the most justifiable 5* weapon upgrades. Over sustained fights, they even outperform The Widsith R5. However it’s still important to know The Widsith will still have higher output in a burst period. The differences between the two are small mathematically, although Tome of the Eternal Flow has lower Base Atk with more Crit, plus it also restores extra energy for Klee. Therefore generally it can perform slightly better in common teams. It also gives a small HP% increase to Klee to help survivability in these teams. Meanwhile Cashflow Supervision has high Base Atk and ATK%, therefore can pull ahead in teams without Bennett. The ATK SPD increase is insignificant. Kagura’s Verity Can be considered BiS in non-Furina teams for players who don’t want to deal with The Widsith’s RNG. Caution: Its power with Klee is entirely reliant on a bug, and one of these beneficial bugs has already been patched as of Version 2.6. Don’t specifically pull for Kagura’s Verity without understanding this. How to abuse the stacking bug (similar to 4pc CW): E > Press Q Fast > E > E Its passive will boost her Elemental Skill damage 3 times and then boost rest of her skillset moderately. Note, this is unable to be maintained for consecutive rotations, but E > Press Q Fast > E can still be used to increase Elemental Skill damage. Link to Kagura’s Verity investigations by solo#3333 Note: The investigations above are from Version 2.5, check Klee’s Evidence Vault for the most updated information. Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds Marginally weaker than Kagura’s Verity over time, but still highly recommended due to it coming from the Standard Banner/Off Rates rather than needing to put dedicated pulls towards it.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"P0gKib8pTZzeWwHeRaPhloy3WPGVKJqFR65o9fdwnCw="},"bd32482d-6bba-4b4b-9803-a655ce7f69cb":{"id_":"bd32482d-6bba-4b4b-9803-a655ce7f69cb","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"cfef012e-2ec5-440e-98c6-b9609944ab29","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"P0gKib8pTZzeWwHeRaPhloy3WPGVKJqFR65o9fdwnCw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"fd1f2e0d-6513-4bc3-941b-353a8512bc7d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"QIqpgF9GKuU8gmfMc9hjd/eDdQjrl7ULvGOBoVcN6vk="}},"text":"While the passive looks strong on paper, the bonus resets upon swap-out, and the long ramp-up time means that Klee’s Elemental Burst will never benefit from it fully. It’s amazing in 4-player Co-Op as well as exploration, for when you have Klee on the field nearly all the time. If Klee has heavy ATK stat saturation via buffs like Bennett’s Burst, Noblesse Oblige, which is a fairly common build situation, Lost Prayer performs essentially the same or slightly stronger than Skyward Atlas. Importantly it can then be considered fairly better due to its stat spread enabling higher crit value to benefit Klee’s Ascension 4 Passive. Also note, if Klee is swapped out whilst the passive is at 0 stacks but with time on the internal counter, say 3 seconds out of the 4 needed, when she switches back in this counter will resume and only 1 second will need to pass for the first stack to be live. The movement bonus is also very noticeable and useful. Skyward Atlas Good 5* option generally speaking, though overtaken by both The Widsith R5 when used properly, and often Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds in a fully buffed team. Not only does this boast the highest base stat for catalysts, but also has free stats from passive, and a bonus cloud to do DPS on top of that. However, the cloud damage is considered physical damage, so it’s a small bonus, but a bonus nonetheless. These passive hits account for less than 4% of Klee’s total damage. Although minor damage, it is important to note that, once proc’d, the physical passive continues even after Klee has left the field. Memory of Dust Very similar raw power to Skyward Atlas, but thematically designed to be played alongside a shielder. Mathematically, it’s difficult to be precise about comparing it due to the intrinsic differences in regards to building stacks per hit and designing different teams. Although regardless, in a 1 to 1 comparison, Skyward Atlas’s passive Elemental DMG Bonus and cloud hits, although small, will generally make it perform better. Practically too, at present it is challenging to build a composition to take advantage of this. Using a “weaker” team to accommodate such a shielder just to get an additional 20% ATK is a net loss, even if that shielder is Zhongli.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"fVSCiROenI9o5PoNAtEMdmX+7h34oJMT0cPgN7SYqS8="},"fd1f2e0d-6513-4bc3-941b-353a8512bc7d":{"id_":"fd1f2e0d-6513-4bc3-941b-353a8512bc7d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bd32482d-6bba-4b4b-9803-a655ce7f69cb","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"fVSCiROenI9o5PoNAtEMdmX+7h34oJMT0cPgN7SYqS8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"71ce6644-d1bc-47f4-a571-f35b27deee8d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"W7VP5ocvj/H+4UNpyQ3ZhFKO6IKPKEnoQ0OBnTa+po0="}},"text":"However, this is only from the lens of overall team damage min-maxing, so if you want to optimise Klee’s damage and intend on playing with a shielder, then it thematically goes hand in hand with Memory of Dust. Tulaytullah’s Remembrance Unfortunately, the latest Crit Catalyst ends up similar to Skyward Atlas in practice. Its increase to Normal Attacks in isolation is powerful, however in the grand scheme they are not a significant part of Klee’s total damage. Since it doesn’t really give anything to her other attacks, and has lower overall Crit Value than Kagura’s Verity and LPSW, it lags behind. Still, the higher Base Attack can be valuable when playing in teams without Bennett. In practice, Klee’s Normal Attacks also have little AoE and range compared to the rest of her kit, further hampering the benefits of this weapon. Not recommended to pull this for Klee, but it’s a solid choice if already obtained. Artifacts\n\nActual artifact performance can vary significantly depending on substat rolls on your personal account. Know that Klee does not have a specific artifact set effect that transcends stats, like Viridescent Venerer would for an Anemo character, Blizzard Strayer on a freeze team, or also how Diluc or Bennett Main DPS can make full use of Crimson Witch of Flames stacking passive. Therefore all recommendations for Klee are fairly close to one another, and rankings will shift for you depending on how good your pieces are. Overall, with equal substats, BiS sets can do around 2-5% more damage (depending on teams), which is valuable or insignificant entirely depending on how much you want to min-max. Note: It is highly recommended to treat the following section as a general guideline. Ultimately, we recommend using the Genshin Optimizer to finalize your builds.

Importantly, many players could easily have Gladiator’s Finale or Shimenawa’s Reminiscence artifacts with strong substats, therefore this combination could make up your overall strongest set. For Enabler Builds\n\nTeams using Klee as an Enabler revolve around her constantly applying Pyro onto enemies, leaving them with a consistent Pyro aura. 4pc Lavawalker provides 35% DMG  Bonus to all attacks in this scenario, which–given equal substats–makes this set the overall strongest in these compositions. It is important to note that some enemies like Slimes have innate Elemental auras, meaning damage will be lost due to the inability to maintain a Pyro aura on them. For Reaction Builds\n\n4pc Crimson Witch of Flames—if the player is lucky to have obtained strong pieces—is very beneficial in teams where Klee triggers Reactions. Note that this Vaporize damage boost stacks additively with Elemental Mastery. The 15% Pyro DMG boost from the initial 2pc set is combined with a 7.5%-15% additional Pyro DMG boost depending on Jumpy Dumpty charges. By abusing the stacking bug, Klee will gain an extra stack (2 or 3 total stacks) than normally possible from the 4pc passive. With 2 charges: E > Press Q Fast > E > E (gains 3 stacks) With 1 charge: E > Press Q Fast > E (gains 2 stacks)\n\n(Update: A variation of this bug has been patched as of Version 2.6)\n\nRegardless of supports, Klee has standard elemental application ICD on most of her attacks, so she cannot trigger Reactions on every hit. Niche/Copium Substitutes\n\nWith good sub stats, a 2pc Wanderer’s Troupe can substitute in a Main DPS Reaction team. Also if you happen to have C1 on Klee, it’s damage is boosted by Noblesse Oblige’s 2pc set effect, so it can work as a universal substitute with any composition if you have very strong sub stats.

ATK% on the Timepiece, Pyro DMG% on the Goblet, and Crit Rate/DMG on the Circlet. Sub stat priorities are Energy Recharge% until sustainable for teams (only a few rolls needed if teaming with another Pyro, closer to 140% if solo) > CRIT Rate/DMG >> ATK% >>> ATK > Rest. However with Main DPS Reaction teams, Elemental Mastery is just as important as ATK% for sub stats, and can be used on the Timepiece as the main stat if you have very strong sub stats. Emphasis on very strong, even in Reaction teams Klee performs a lot of non Reaction damage, and therefore ATK% is still preferable. So what teams could I run? Klee is a very versatile character. As with most other pyro carries, with hydro supports, she can be played as a main carry who’s damage is “amped” by vaporise reactions to unleash strong personal damage. Moreover, due to her explosive mayhem via consistently strong and frequent pyro application, she is also able to be used as an “enabler”, where she lays the pyro foundation for powerful reaction damage from teammates like Furina to create teams with more “shared” damage. Lastly, one of her most popular uses is with “Mono Pyro” compositions, where teams forgo Reactions and Klee is run alongside characters like Bennett and Xiangling with grouping and Viridescent Venerer support via a final Anemo member. With fully synergistic teammates, (and Energy requirements being alleviated due to shared Pyro Particles) this madness has enough buffs to make sure you don’t take brute force lightly. A word of caution: Do not try to play teams with both Cryo and Hydro support. As touched on earlier, Klee’s attacks are heavy attacks, and therefore the shatter reaction is prioritised before vaporize or melt, which is significantly weaker in performance than either. An important note about shields/resistance to interruption\n\nAs touched on earlier, Klee is more squishy than the average character, meaning she is more prone to getting staggered out of an attack than most others. This is compounded by her relatively limited range, promoting in-your-face gameplay. Therefore she cannot keep distance over enemies and therefore fairly susceptible to melee attacks.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"rCQuWgRoTtmYgqMs6dAHic7iFBlaF6ms9Ws1Td7I7J0="},"e47a7a91-4029-4320-960f-25f12122cd1f":{"id_":"e47a7a91-4029-4320-960f-25f12122cd1f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"256ff606-7c55-4ed5-ab37-fae7a00cd011","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"rCQuWgRoTtmYgqMs6dAHic7iFBlaF6ms9Ws1Td7I7J0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c2063990-4db4-4c55-9319-a266a800ea9a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"7c9afPBEtqefHZgjgzpu/6JLnnXGRYb9WXAsnW8ECPk="}},"text":"Therefore she cannot keep distance over enemies and therefore fairly susceptible to melee attacks. Fortunately, there are several ways to alleviate this issue. Shields: Zhongli (Hold Elemental Skill), Beidou (Elemental Burst with Constellation 1), Diona (Elemental Skill) Interrupt Resistance Talent: Whilst casting a Charge Attack with an Explosive Spark active, Klee has increased interrupt resistance. This will prevent her from being staggered. Characters: Zhongli (Hold Elemental Skill), Beidou (Elemental Burst), Xingqiu (Elemental Skill), Geo Traveler (Elemental Burst but uncommon in Klee Teams) Note, Xingqiu’s resistance to interruption isn’t actually that strong by itself to render Klee stagger proof against most stronger attacks. However this will stack with other’s for example when combined with Beidou, you get full resistance. However, it is important to understand that by having to use one of these supports you may be restricting her team diversity and potentially having to remove another supportive character who could contribute more to her overall team damage. For instance, a Reverse Melt composition with Zhongli would have to forgo either Bennett (who 1. provides significant damage to both Klee and the Cryo Sub DPS, 2. without him Klee may encounter energy issues), or the Anemo grouper (Venti/Sucrose/Kazuha), which losing that crowd control would again hamper both Klee and the stationary Sub DPS Rosaria. Overall, although it may require a lot more skill and care with Klee, improving your dodging skills and not having to rely on shields/resistance to interruption as a crutch gives you much more freedom and in many instances, allows you to run overall stronger teams.

Want to play Klee’s highest damage potential teams which don’t have a shielder. Consider the team’s healing adequate. How synergistic is she with the current roster? Klee has particularly good synergy with the Pyro and Anemo cast, both damage and utility wise. Therefore she excels in Mono Pyro teams. She also synergises incredibly well with Furina, and Klee’s playstyle functions similarly to Mono teams except Furina is Vaporizing on top. It is highly encouraged to read and digest the team building sections of this guide, and then go in game and finetune your own teams to fit your own playstyle. FAQ: Why is Vaporize less important on Klee? Contrary to popular belief, it actually has little to do with her applying “too much Pyro to work”, since there are teams and playstyles which can get her Vaporising consistently. Many Pyro carries in Genshin Impact deal damage with one Talent source at a time. A typical Hu Tao uses her Normal and Charged Attacks, and will pause those to use her Burst. Diluc has his Burst and then alternates between Normal Atks and Elemental Skills. Xiangling does initially have both Guoba and Pyronado as DMG sources, but the majority of her window, especially in AoE uses Pyronado as her single reactive source. Bennett alternates with Normal Attacks, Elemental Skill and Bursts. Klee is unlike these others, and failure to understand this is the root source of misplay and poor analysis of her strategies. She weaves Normal and Charged Attacks with Burst lasers firing and mines explode around them. By herself, she is constantly dealing damage distributed almost evenly from all 3 of her Talents, and furthermore all these Talents provide DMG via multiple fast, smaller, and sustained hits. For the other characters, especially with favorable Elemental application ICD, their type of playstyle scales well with Vaporize/Melt. Their power budget in an attack sequence being generally distributed through 1 attack at a time makes great use of these Reaction multipliers. Vaporize is only a multiplier after all. Purely a 1.5x or 2x multiplier that also unlocks Elemental Mastery for an additional unique multiplier.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"7c9afPBEtqefHZgjgzpu/6JLnnXGRYb9WXAsnW8ECPk="},"90482ad8-4f8b-481f-9c8b-b09a767b4765":{"id_":"90482ad8-4f8b-481f-9c8b-b09a767b4765","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c2063990-4db4-4c55-9319-a266a800ea9a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"7c9afPBEtqefHZgjgzpu/6JLnnXGRYb9WXAsnW8ECPk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1061b888-6f63-441a-94a2-e3cf8c228a01","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"vlBbSygUhKnoWrEiwzprXHsbQhN/xACFhMB3MAO/72U="}},"text":"The more frequently a character can react the more consistent their access to these multipliers are. Yet, as insinuated, these Amplifying Reactions are ultimately only multipliers. For Klee, even if one were to practice a gameplay style which allows consistent Vaporize Reactions for one of these Talent sources, like her Normal and Charged Attacks, this is only adding a multiplier onto what is normally around 1/3 of her total damage. Instead, why not look for ways to 100% of her total damage via universal Pyro DMG buffs like Kazuha’s A4 or Xiangling’s C6? Even if these multipliers may appear smaller, the ability for these to boost her Skill and Burst can make them much more synergistic overall. It can help to see similarities with a more understood character, Tartaglia. Whilst a minority do try his playstyle in Forward Vape/Sunfire teams, the vast majority recognize that his performance is stronger, flexible and more practical outside of this. Klee is like this too. What future teammates does Klee look out for? Look out for future off-field damage dealers that stand to gain from a “driver” like Klee who can sustain significant pyro application on field. Even more so if their attacks are mobile and can move with Klee amidst the chaos. Overall, Klee as an reaction enabler is in the position to utilise a support like this much better than her pyro contemporaries, so solidifying a stronger niche in the future will keep her in good stead. 4.1 Update: We predicted Furina, woohoo! In terms of indirect buffs as a whole, Klee luckily has several unique identifiers that are not currently exploited in-game, but have a shot at being targeted in the future:\n\nHigh hit count. Hit count mechanics are not something explored much in Genshin Impact, but are common in Honkai Impact 3rd, Genshin’s sister game. Examples would range from Skills that scale higher the more hits are dealt, to Bosses with Shields that need take a certain amount of hits to be taken down. Klee in full swing has a barrage of hits across the game period, but if you consider things like a new artifact set or Support for Pyro characters, or a Catalyst weapon, narrowing the prospective characters even further makes Klee stand out more in these situations.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"7DXBB/1PLvX5ymHy00hb3hLNP73TVSr2S8KnWw1mO/8="},"1061b888-6f63-441a-94a2-e3cf8c228a01":{"id_":"1061b888-6f63-441a-94a2-e3cf8c228a01","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"90482ad8-4f8b-481f-9c8b-b09a767b4765","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"7DXBB/1PLvX5ymHy00hb3hLNP73TVSr2S8KnWw1mO/8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1b91fb56-d556-4c0c-afe5-41098eca5354","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"GX4ENO4l10vjbZDlyDcu4q2U85dk1hzjhYNSVOu9BPw="}},"text":"Whilst Genshin hasn’t moved much in this scale, it is possible to see signs of small advancements considering characters like Yunjin’s Buffs or Quicken reactions. Whilst these do not consider Hit count directly, additive increases like these, typically, are designed to be beneficial towards attacks which hit fast with lower multipliers (with Quicken also factoring in Elemental application rate), as opposed to slower hits with higher base multipliers. Full range of attack sources. Klee is one of the few characters, who in their natural role is attacking with Normal Attacks, Charge Attacks, Elemental Skill hits and constant Elemental Burst hits. For Bow characters, Polar Star already exists as an example weapon that increases in performance with diverse attack activation. Even then, Polar Star’s Buffs last 12s per attack, a fairly long time. Klee could maintain uptime of Buffs with far shorter durations. There aren’t many other Catalyst or Pyro characters who tread into this territory, so anything new here can also be effective. General Synergies\n\nSo we’ve covered Klee’s strengths, weaknesses, and considerations that need to be made when building a team. It is important to stress that despite not having access to an amazingly synergistic Sub DPS teammate currently, Klee does have synergy with strong supports who often appear as the consistent backbone to the wide variety of compositions available. Is Bennett needed in every Klee team? Due to the large variety of strategies, not really, but it is important to understand how well he synergises with Klee, and therefore how borderline irreplaceable he is. Firstly, he enables Klee to require essentially no additional energy recharge bonuses to produce her Burst on demand. Secondly, Klee herself and the vast majority of team mates regardless of exact composition have snapshottable abilities, on top of benefitting hugely from Bennett’s huge attack buff in general, so his supportive boosts provide huge increases in overall team DPS. When can he be replaced? (click to expand)\n\n1. Xiangling can substitute for additional Pyro Energy to Klee, and her personal output is strong enough that to a degree it can mitigate overall team damage loss from losing Bennett’s attack buff. Generally speaking, given Xiangling has enough Energy Recharge to accommodate, she can work as a universal replacement outside of Vaporize teams.

In tough content, a full shield may be preferable to relying on Bennett’s healing. Zhongli himself can fill Bennett’s shoes, with his strong shield that also decreases the Elemental RES and Physical RES of opponents nearby by 20%. Note, in 99% of situations, this resulting damage increase will be noticeably weaker than what Bennett would have provided, but it does work as a substitute. Also understand that Zhongli replacing Bennett will leave Klee needing much more Energy Recharge bonus to cover for the resulting loss in Pyro energy, so for example you can say Zhongli+Xiangling are needed in order to fill Bennett’s slot. Due to Xiangling’s high off-field damage and high Pyro application rate, she is often played in a wide variety of teams in Genshin Impact. However, a common theme with her teams is that they generally have to accommodate her high Energy demands, and therefore most of her teams either spend significant portions of time having to battery her, or have higher than average rotation lengths. Due to Klee’s prowess in Energy generation, especially high Pyro Particle generation with her initial two charges of Jumpy Dumpty, this allows Klee-Bennett-Xiangling teams to be one of the few Xiangling teams where her costly Burst is not burdensome and easily used off-cooldown. Further synergy is provided with Xiangling’s C1 and C6 constellations (even Klee’s C6 for high spenders) , small damage increases however, they can add up. Notably, since Xiangling’s Burst does not normally snapshot her C6, therefore it is typically considered a weak constellation, Klee is able to perfectly make use of it. Xiangling’s Pyronado will also follow Klee around, and Snapshots team buffs similar to Klee’s Burst, allowing the duo tons of freedom for movement and positioning as needed with little drawback. Many people may look at Xiangling’s EM ascension stat and Pyronado’s reaction potential and then write off her multipurpose kit for synergy in Pyro teams with Klee.

Aside from Normal Attacks which have a tendency to be thrown too low, Klee can do this with all her attacks. Furthermore, Venti’s burst provides elemental infusion which is extremely helpful especially in conjunction with Xingqiu, as this constant Hydro application allows Klee to Vaporize Jumpy Dumpty hits she otherwise could not. With Reverse Melt teams, this infusion allows Cryo supports to be melting even before Klee switches in. It is an extremely advantageous position to be a character that can synergise with Venti. However please note Mihoyo has steadily scaled back on Venti favorable content and you might find limited effectiveness of his strengths in current end-game situations. Kazuha is a key top tier support character that synergises incredibly with Klee. On the surface, unlike Venti his suction ability is able to pull in Klee’s Jumpy Dumpty and mines, but most importantly is his general prowess in easily applying Viridescent Venerer debuffs in both mono-elemental and reaction teams. He typically performs much better applying this than other Anemo characters.This is in addition to his ability to give himself and his teammates an Elemental DMG Bonus% when swirling an element. This puts him in a position where his team damage boosting benefits are often too hard to ignore. To top it off, his suction effects, although weaker than Venti’s, do not have the potential to send enemies flying in the air, giving him much better synergy with common Klee teammates Rosaria and Xiangling. Overall, although in a strict 1:1 comparison he may not be as useful as Venti in certain mobbing combat situations where Venti’s crowd control expertise is too valuable, these factors make him inarguably much more synergistic in the majority of other situations with Klee. You will probably find he is often an ideal fit no matter what idea or team play style you decide on building.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"cKxZQFKvfQchYcPNbIMQcrdZbX3RWigenJp1mNwphsA="},"947ebf93-a8f2-4ebb-a15f-f0a0bd76c478":{"id_":"947ebf93-a8f2-4ebb-a15f-f0a0bd76c478","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7cf5210d-5b7a-4771-b025-91ba1bd75cdf","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"cKxZQFKvfQchYcPNbIMQcrdZbX3RWigenJp1mNwphsA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f12090f3-17e6-45a1-bb74-6d2c6f19ba90","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"8xMDamgc6jm312XPxwkSnfVj8qB4bLI1jpjQcTrbWhc="}},"text":"Venti and Kazuha can be somewhat substituted with Sucrose. She brings additional sources of damage boosts to the table via her Elemental Mastery sharing talents and potential to wield Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers. She can also provide elemental infusion and gathering, although not as strong. Importantly, she is a 4* character who also does her job at low constellations and with a 3* weapon, making her very handy and cheap for any account. Ultimately, Venti’s significantly stronger crowd control, personal damage and energy refunds via his Ascension 4 Passive Talent, Stormeye, his overall contribution is sizably larger and therefore make up stronger Klee teams. Moreover, Kazuha’s damage boosts can in a vacuum be smaller, but his ability to better execute VV debuffs ultimately synergises a lot better with Klee’s teams by being able to buff multiple members with DMG Bonus%. This is especially important as Klee teams often have high amounts of non-reaction damage. With Klee’s teams never relying purely on her own damage, Zhongli’s universal RES Shred via his shield is incredibly handy to increase the output of several team damage sources. In addition, as mentioned earlier Klee can benefit highly from his Interrupt Resist, allowing her to plow through damage without getting staggered from incoming hits. This can be especially important in compositions where Klee is the Enabler, as losing hits from her also results in weaker output from the rest of the team. An unfortunate weakness with Zhongli is that teams are limited to 4 members, and due to his weak energy output, slotting him in place of someone else can leave Klee teams, especially herself, in an energy deficit. Additionally, his slot in Klee teams is often competing with Bennett or Venti, who have both proven to provide tons of energy and boost teams to generally much higher damage output. When using Zhongli, this loss in energy and damage output is something you have to weigh out. Energy Recharge Guidelines\n\nNote: Multiple ballpark figures are given. For average players, in order to prepare for all situations, build for the higher value. Starts of fights/Abyss Chambers will allow Klee two uses of her Skill, meaning you can build lower if you can avoid sustained fights.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"mOcP0zPSwhRkARWNMzXtKUEvgZY/jL483TSszpoznxY="},"f12090f3-17e6-45a1-bb74-6d2c6f19ba90":{"id_":"f12090f3-17e6-45a1-bb74-6d2c6f19ba90","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"947ebf93-a8f2-4ebb-a15f-f0a0bd76c478","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"mOcP0zPSwhRkARWNMzXtKUEvgZY/jL483TSszpoznxY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e75749bf-a7f9-43f3-b758-60c6b6cff9df","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"NTjUEsK5yN1x5knkVV6TMN5rWSjDW45rcd9y8N41ZQo="}},"text":"If you do not meet these Energy requirements, it’s not the end of the world as you can easily create Energy with the team’s Elemental Skills, as the small cost of a longer rotation. Due to Klee’s low reliance on Amplification, most teams easily allow this flexibility. Teams\n\n※ Vaporize ※\n\nWith Furina’s release in 4.2, Klee finally gained a long awaited playstyle update where another teammate could take advantage of her Pyro application rate and trigger their own reactions. Furina synergised even more though, since she also buffs Klee (and the whole team) in return. To further explain, the two are very synergistic. The ideal reaction partner for Klee has always been theorised to be a slow hitting, but high damage off-field character with a good enough elemental ICD rate to Vaporize or Melt most of their damage. Luckily, Furina’s hardest hits are from Mademoiselle Crabaletta, who can also Vaporize every hit. Her other pets also can vaporize but not all hits. She can also vaporize the initial hits from her Elemental Skill and Burst casts. Lastly, being able to vaporize allows Furina’s damage to scale from EM. This is very helpful because HP scaling damage dealers have limited buff sources, so opening this avenue for more damage is great. Overall for Furina, the damage she can gain from Vaporize is very valuable. Not only does Klee benefit from Furina’s damage% buffs from Fanfare stacks, but Furina enables very significant gear upgrades for Klee. Marechausse Hunter is a very powerful artifact set enabled by Furina’s HP drain, netting on average a 15-20% increase for Klee over her previous mixed artifact sets. Furina’s HP drain also allows Klee to fully utilise 5* catalysts like Tome of the Eternal Flow and Cashflow Supervision which also pull ahead of previous 5* catalysts and are more competitive with The Widsith. Klee is notably also relatively on the lower end of HP levels. Once built at Level 90 players will usually have around 16-18k HP. Whilst an initial concern may be that this is not great synergy with Furina, it’s arguably the opposite. This means Klee is relatively very easy to heal, and in particular easy overheal.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"8xMDamgc6jm312XPxwkSnfVj8qB4bLI1jpjQcTrbWhc="},"e75749bf-a7f9-43f3-b758-60c6b6cff9df":{"id_":"e75749bf-a7f9-43f3-b758-60c6b6cff9df","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f12090f3-17e6-45a1-bb74-6d2c6f19ba90","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"8xMDamgc6jm312XPxwkSnfVj8qB4bLI1jpjQcTrbWhc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"713ae509-b891-462c-8a9c-05e122ec1f0a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MmDjbheir2t3f/kDC69sEgElXB/74JS0pe4Fo6MKmcI="}},"text":"This means Klee is relatively very easy to heal, and in particular easy overheal.

Note: this is generally not recommended, as touched on in FAQ: Why is Vaporize less important on Klee\n\nHydro Applicator Options\n\nNOTE: It is never recommended to withhold Klee’s Elemental Burst for “consistent” Vape strategies. It is a big part of her damage. Xingqiu, an accessible 4*, has a long lasting Elemental Burst providing Klee high uptime of Vaporize Reactions. His Hydro swords produced from his Burst fire from range, and often apply before Klee’s projectile attacks hit. He will also provide additional Hydro application from the radiating swords if Klee hugs enemies, which is crucial to maintain consistency of application. Note, his hydro swords only fire when Klee uses a Normal Attack, which can make for unnatural gameplay. He does however come with more downsides. Due to the inconsistent nature of both his and Klee’s projectile-based attacks, and situations where Klee is not hugging enemies, at base these Reactions can be inconsistent. Occasionally, Klee’s Pyro attacks will become the aura instead, and Xingqiu will end up dealing a weak Vaporize hit instead. Nevertheless, this inconsistency is virtually solved if his Constellation 6 is acquired. Now, every third hit will apply an additional two swords, which provide an extra application of Hydro aura onto the enemy that Klee is about to hit. This acts as a hard reset to solve any situations with an unexpected Pyro aura. When using Xingqiu as the sole Hydro applicator, it is recommended as Klee to use N2C N1C combos repeatedly to sync for consistent Vaporized Charge Attacks. Yelan will also work well in these teams, mainly due to her own natural synergy with Xingqiu. Functioning similarly by requiring Normal Attacks, alone she will not be able to provide Hydro application for the Vaporize composition to function sufficiently (in fact, Klee will enable Yelan to Forward Vaporize her own attacks for a 2x damage multiplier). Yet together with Xingqiu, the increased application can allow Klee to spam anything, notably N1C combos instead of workarounds.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"voJXNIhKooT+hQ45vR2hUewaietwgGpier7BEgtbYcE="},"bf01b4df-1a2f-49c3-85a9-9e6f60180b89":{"id_":"bf01b4df-1a2f-49c3-85a9-9e6f60180b89","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7bb6cf63-f3b2-439b-acc4-99d0a7c578cb","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"voJXNIhKooT+hQ45vR2hUewaietwgGpier7BEgtbYcE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"60b51f64-e7e7-4fdb-85d9-88461f0bc12f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"PGtKfTfkTHv0FI6W1HnBHPXlGqavQYuZlQ25NLOcDCs="}},"text":"Her Ascension Talent 4 will also provide buffs to Klee’s output, as well as team repositioning and mini-grouping via her Hold E Skill. These damage buffs and dynamic movement are much appreciated, especially as the fixed core of Klee-Xingqiu-Yelan leaves a lot needed from the 4th teammate. Vaporize Example Team Klee/Bennett/Xingqiu/Yelan\n\nTeam Description\n\nFor players without Kazuha or want to play Vaporise compositions, this is a good pick. As explained above, the relentless Hydro application from the team will allow Klee to do whichever combos you wish and Vaporise her Charged Attacks consistently. Furthermore, as also mentioned Yelan provides DMG%, repositioning, and mini-grouping which are helpful to cover Kazuha’s impact. In fact her repositioning is actually pretty useful as it allows Stamina regeneration. However, not all is well. The lack of proper Anemo grouping not only reduces the consistency of Klee’s mines being used, but even in general reduces QoL without proper crowd control. Secondly, as mentioned throughout the guide, even with perfect Hydro application, Klee is still Vaporising only around ⅓ of her Normal Attacks, Elemental Skill and Burst due to standard ICD on those hits. Lastly, whilst Bennett is essential for completing the team with healing, Energy and significant buffs to Klee, his buff will not apply to the Hydro pair. This leaves the team synergy much to be desired. Nonetheless, this team is a strong alternative option mainly for Bossing encounters. The extra Hydro application can also have great value for shield-breaking content.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"EXNJNJDu7ZutL4I2PgGja4cScu7CuPXEZWhV14jZhyE="},"60b51f64-e7e7-4fdb-85d9-88461f0bc12f":{"id_":"60b51f64-e7e7-4fdb-85d9-88461f0bc12f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bf01b4df-1a2f-49c3-85a9-9e6f60180b89","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"EXNJNJDu7ZutL4I2PgGja4cScu7CuPXEZWhV14jZhyE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"752c7697-27c5-4055-97c5-65b77102f6ba","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"XPFHdsuUqFLJ+g5Mw4n1BYw/epUP3L0LUff1L+fb91E="}},"text":"The extra Hydro application can also have great value for shield-breaking content.

Furina’s damage increases and she provides buffs for Klee in return. Klee has stronger artifact and weapon options thanks to Furina’s HP drain. Better vertical investment potential than other teams. Multi element teams have more flexible shield breaking potential. Cons:\n\nHeavily benefits from Furina. Requires more complex setups than Mono Pyro teams. Also the teammates will be fluctuating with lower HP due to Furina’s drain. Therefore they can be overall harder teams to play. Overall Conclusion on Reverse Vaporize Teams\n\nPros:\n\nRequires less overall team investment, due to most of the team damage funneled into Klee. Therefore very feasible for players not yet at late game levels of investment. Elemental Mastery becomes a very useful offensive stat for Klee, therefore you have more opportunities for overall stronger artifacts. Hydro teammates can break Pyro shields. Cons:\n\nXingqiu is essentially mandatory support on many other teams, but he is not essential for Klee. So this would limit options for your other team, some of which are able to utilise him to a higher overall performance. With Xingqiu, rotations are awkward due to his longer cooldowns, and with Mona, Hydro application can be poor if rotations are not performed efficiently.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"PGtKfTfkTHv0FI6W1HnBHPXlGqavQYuZlQ25NLOcDCs="},"752c7697-27c5-4055-97c5-65b77102f6ba":{"id_":"752c7697-27c5-4055-97c5-65b77102f6ba","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"60b51f64-e7e7-4fdb-85d9-88461f0bc12f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"PGtKfTfkTHv0FI6W1HnBHPXlGqavQYuZlQ25NLOcDCs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"94157f5a-4591-4f89-9c38-bb6de99196d3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"G4uYcAg1XJScsBUJBUad80r5g4VPrwdn2H5/GxaT6uc="}},"text":"Xingqiu support gets substantially better at C6, so not that accessible.

Important: A common misconception of newer players is thinking that this team is played as a consolation, because Klee “cannot take advantage of Reactions”. This is incorrect, this team is played due to the incredible synergy between all 4 characters. It just happens to not have Reactions (beyond Swirl). High DMG per screenshot ≠ High DMG per second! Charged Attacks are only a portion of Klee’s natural damage output, whereas these teams amplify 100% her output (see Talent Priority to learn more). A team having or not having Reactions like Melt/Vaporize has zero predisposition to whether it makes a good team.

Team Description\n\nThe premise is simple: Viridescent Venerer’s Pyro infused debuff provides a 27.7% damage increase against the typical enemy (who has 10% base resistance). Without having to worry about reactions and controlling aura application, it is extremely simple and easy to keep this debuff on enemies. Coupled with Xiangling’s inconsistent C1 debuff and her small but solid 15% Pyro DMG boost from her C6, team damage is amplified enough to not have to fret about not using amplification reactions. The main drawback is due to going all in with Pyro, it is not as efficient for shield breaking scenarios, which are fairly common in end game content. Kazuha is a tremendous addition to the roster, as not only is he very good at applying VV, but unlike Sucrose’s EM sharing, his team buffs will benefit non-reaction teams with the additional Pyro DMG bonus. He also has additional synergy with Klee and Xiangling as his Skill will draw in mines and Gouba. Another benefit to Kazuha is his respectable damage whilst on the field using Skills and regenerating energy. Xiangling Elemental Burst has a longer cooldown than the others, so the team’s rotations generally extend to around 20-22s to accommodate her.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"G4uYcAg1XJScsBUJBUad80r5g4VPrwdn2H5/GxaT6uc="},"393612a6-0e2f-4c85-bc86-b441519b2e6d":{"id_":"393612a6-0e2f-4c85-bc86-b441519b2e6d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"94157f5a-4591-4f89-9c38-bb6de99196d3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"G4uYcAg1XJScsBUJBUad80r5g4VPrwdn2H5/GxaT6uc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"dc9d8766-9243-463b-b36e-fc055d3b9281","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"OjbSEIG2oPNAk2MfmGWYNsx69tDQBEupPj0TZrBtUbs="}},"text":"This team is very rotationally flexible and feels smooth to play in both Single Target and AoE content. Rotationally flexible, meaning you can easily delay Xiangling’s burst until needed, add extra Kazuha Skill usage for on demand grouping, or even stay on Klee longer or shorter depending on if juggling is valued or the enemies are already dead. This is in comparison to some other Hypercarry lead teams in the game which can have strict set-ups and set infusion/damage windows. One significant value proposition with this team is its high floor on damage output. Essentially, aside from Klee’s basic attacks, the entire team’s output snapshots a ton of buffs and abilities do not require triggers like needing constant normal attacks. Xiangling’s Pyronado will spin regardless, Klee’s Burst will home onto enemies, and even her leftover mines will be pulled to wherever the player positions Kazuha. This can make the team easier to pilot than other Klee teams and even other Xiangling teams as there can be less variance in total output from a skilled player vs one of less skill; by the time Klee EQE’s, most of the work is done. Of course, skilled players effectively positioning, animation canceling and Charge Attacking during Klee’s damage window will produce greater numbers, but the team’s combined sources of guaranteed damage is sizable. The point isn’t even finished, as this is not only referring to the damage itself, but team Energy too. Even though Klee’s Charge Atks generate good tail-end energy for the team, the rest of the team’s Skills, including potentially two of Klee’s Skill charges, are front loaded before Klee’s basic attack damage window. This means whether enemies are defeated earlier than expected, or at the end of a rotation, it’s highly likely you will start the next Abyss chamber with the team’s Energy in a healthy situation. This is exemplified by Klee being able to start an alternate rotation with her first Skill charge, allowing her to even patch up the team before a fight really starts. This makes the team incredibly fluid across an entire Abyss Floor, and is proven with consistently strong performances in Continuous speedruns.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"d4LA8ddJn9VAASI0Wo6/NkNEBWwYhyxqFGnM/VVu8Oo="},"dc9d8766-9243-463b-b36e-fc055d3b9281":{"id_":"dc9d8766-9243-463b-b36e-fc055d3b9281","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"393612a6-0e2f-4c85-bc86-b441519b2e6d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"d4LA8ddJn9VAASI0Wo6/NkNEBWwYhyxqFGnM/VVu8Oo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"38b66730-7a82-45b6-b0c1-74ca788ed3dd","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"BHNZ3XEC5v5nzm39JwJD1+B9bqjErNZipPKf33arRpI="}},"text":"Team Gearing\n\nKlee Kazuha Bennett Xiangling Example Weapons: The Widsith Flowing Purity Artifacts: 2pc ATK/2 CW or 4pc Lavawalker ER% Ballpark: 125% w/long fights 100% w/fights under 40s Example Weapons: Iron Sting Favonius Sword Artifacts: 4pc Viridescent Venerer ER/EM/EM or EM/EM/EM ER% Ballpark: 170% w/long fights 160% w/fights under 40s Example Weapon: Sapwood Blade Artifacts: 4pc Noblesse Oblige ER/Pyro/CRIT or ATK/Pyro/CRIT ER% Ballpark: 155% w/long fights 125% w/fights under 40s Example Weapon: “The Catch” Artifacts: 4pc EoSF ATK/Pyro/CRIT ER% Ballpark: 200% w/long fights 170% w/fights under 40s\n\nRotation Example\n\nFirst Rotation Only Example Rotation #2 Energy Rotation #3 Fast Setup Rotation #4 Bennett E or Klee N1 Kazuha Tap E + Plunge + Q > Bennett Q + E > Xiangling Q + E > Kazuha (Hold or Tap) E + Plunge > Klee N1 + E + Q + E + 4N1C Repeat from Example Rotation #2 Bennett E > Kazuha Tap E + Plunge + Q > Bennett Q + E > Xiangling Q + E > Kazuha (Hold or Tap) E + Plunge > Klee N1 + E + Q + 4N1C + N1 Repeat Klee E Kazuha Tap E + Plunge + Q > Bennett Q + E > Xiangling Q + E > Kazuha (Hold or Tap) E + Plunge > Klee N1 + E + Q + 4N1C + N1 Repeat Klee N1 Kazuha Q > Bennett Q + E > Xiangling Q + E > Kazuha (Hold or Tap) E + Plunge > Klee N1 + E + Q + E + 4N1C + N1 Kazuha Tap E + Plunge > Repeat from Kazuha Q\n\nRotation Example w/ Sucrose\n\nKlee E (only for the first rotation) / Bennett E (use instead if doing multiple rotations) > Sucrose E + Q > Bennett Q + E > Xiangling Q + E > Sucrose E > Klee N1 + E + Q + 5N1C + N1 Repeat\n\nSucrose’s E is used twice per rotation, which should be sustainable with Constellation 1 and Sacrificial Fragments.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"OjbSEIG2oPNAk2MfmGWYNsx69tDQBEupPj0TZrBtUbs="},"38b66730-7a82-45b6-b0c1-74ca788ed3dd":{"id_":"38b66730-7a82-45b6-b0c1-74ca788ed3dd","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"dc9d8766-9243-463b-b36e-fc055d3b9281","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"OjbSEIG2oPNAk2MfmGWYNsx69tDQBEupPj0TZrBtUbs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b4bc8054-8877-4fe3-a4b7-14b281b8336c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"YoSs0iyH8X4QGfFAVYkWPR57eKpH+DNb8eRiQqh0AkQ="}},"text":"VS Golden Wolflord: https://youtu.be/haJ1yO77_tI\n\nCircular Synergy Breakdown\n\nKazuha:\n\nPyro only teammates makes it easy for him to swirl the correct Element.

On the surface one could argue that Klee is the member getting carried, and while it is true that she ends up being the least important component of the team, she brings enough to the table to where she would become the best choice for the 4th character. With her Skill and Charged Attack, she generates a lot of Energy for the brief time she is on-field, further lowering Energy Recharge requirements. Shielding support isn’t too justified due to the team’s constant crowd control. Unlike Xiangling, Klee can comfortably hit enemies within Venti’s Vortex. Moreover, some enemies are too heavy to be thrown into Venti’s Vortex naturally, however Klee’s Charged Attacks can fling these enemies and force them into it. In fact in general, with her solid natural crowd control due to high staggering ability, this team’s themes are further highlighted. Strictly looking at damage, Klee actually has strong front loaded damage dealing capabilities, and this team does not need her to be on the field long dealing dwindling sustained damage. Burst, 1 or 2 Jumpy Dumpties and around 3 N1C’s can do the job, whilst also leaving mines off-field for Kazuha to draw in.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"YoSs0iyH8X4QGfFAVYkWPR57eKpH+DNb8eRiQqh0AkQ="},"50ec94de-47c8-4a2e-9275-42398b63d437":{"id_":"50ec94de-47c8-4a2e-9275-42398b63d437","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b4bc8054-8877-4fe3-a4b7-14b281b8336c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"YoSs0iyH8X4QGfFAVYkWPR57eKpH+DNb8eRiQqh0AkQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"69bebfc4-bdee-432e-b7c8-027225507fe6","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"CQOeXCsINEVYEMnAjOZzpY0BBRkyc0bErVkGU4HFg/0="}},"text":"Team Gearing\n\nKlee Bennett Venti Kazuha Example Weapons: The Widsith Flowing Purity Artifacts: 2pc ATK/2 CW or 4pc Lavawalker ATK/Pyro/CRIT ER% Ballpark: 140% w/long fights 100% w/fights under 30s Example Weapon: Sapwood Blade Artifacts: 4pc Noblesse Oblige ER/Pyro/CRIT or ATK/Pyro/CRIT ER% Ballpark: 150% w/long fights 120% w/fights under 30s Example Weapons: Favonius Warbow The Stringlesss Artifacts: 4pc Viridescent Venerer EM/EM/EM ER% Ballpark: Additional substats not necessary Example Weapons: Iron Sting Favonius Sword Artifacts: 4pc Viridescent Venerer ER/EM/EM or EM/EM/EM ER% Ballpark: 140% w/long fights 130% w/fights under 30s\n\nRotation Example\n\nFirst Rotation Only Example Rotation #2 Example Rotation #3 Klee N1 Kazuha Hold E + Plunge + Q > Bennett E + Q > Venti E + Q > Klee N1 + E + Q + N1 + E + 3N1C Venti E > Repeat from Kazuha in Example Rotation #2 Klee N1 Kazuha Hold E + Plunge + Q > Bennett E + Q > Venti E + Q > Klee Q + N1 + E + 3N1C + N1 Venti E > Repeat from Kazuha Bennett E + Q > Kazuha Hold E + Plunge + Q > Venti E + Q > Klee Q + N1 + E + 3N1C + N1 Venti E > Repeat\n\nMono Pyro Recommended Team #3 (using Zhongli w/Archaic Petra) Klee/Bennett/Zhongli + Xiangling or Kazuha\n\nPros & Cons\n\nPros:\n\nMakes a solid substitute for Kazuha with the added benefit of a shield: Provides 20% universal debuff + 35% Pyro DMG boost which is easily obtainable due to only having Pyro teammates.

Generally very niche so most players may not even have pieces. Due to the shards often spawning slightly away from Zhongli, it is ultimately not amazingly convenient to pick up and makes awkward moments. Can pick up wrong elemental shards when fighting enemies with innate elemental auras. The team’s damage output gets moderately neutered in this situation. Whilst this has similar damage buffs in theory, you lose grouping and crowd control plus Kazuha’s naturally strong sub-dps output.

At Constellation 6, to a degree she can emulate Kazuha’s DMG Bonus% buffs, but this is not necessary, as her grouping, Viridescent Venerer debuff and burst damage bring value regardless. Needs to be built for Elemental Burst spamming, rather than her typical builds which stack Elemental Mastery stats as high as possible. Recommended ER depends on execution and frequency of Elemental Skill usage, but generally you are looking at over 200% with Favonious Codex. Sacrificial Fragments is great and Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers is possible, especially with her further boosting the team through passing 48% ATK% bonus to Xiangling, however with the large energy requirements needed, using TTDS may be tough. Jean: Can fill in for Kazuha or Venti to cover Viridescent Venerer debuff duties. Unlike others, she will not provide additional buffs/debuffs to the team, hence her being an overall downgrade however her additional healing in tandem with Bennett’s can improve survivability (this can be handy to combat corrosion). She can also position Klee’s bombs through holding her Elemental Skill. Ultimately, she is Klee’s carer so this is fun for role playing purposes. Thoma: Can fill in for any position, providing a solid shield as well as Pyro application and damage, albeit neither in substantial amounts. As Xiangling is rarely played without Bennett, the most viable slot for Thoma is replacing Bennett.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"CQOeXCsINEVYEMnAjOZzpY0BBRkyc0bErVkGU4HFg/0="},"0899216d-f29c-4235-9332-888f92662431":{"id_":"0899216d-f29c-4235-9332-888f92662431","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"69bebfc4-bdee-432e-b7c8-027225507fe6","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"CQOeXCsINEVYEMnAjOZzpY0BBRkyc0bErVkGU4HFg/0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e237efa7-02b9-4aee-9f2c-69e653d5aa54","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"0BrAd8+2G5jG6i3dySamjYy187QA4Y88K3c+G5dTyAs="}},"text":"The team will lose a chunk of attack (Well built Bennett Burst’s alone typically provides somewhere around a 40-50% total damage increase to character), but Thoma’s shield can be very comfortable, and importantly will allow you the luxury of playing Bennett on your other team. Overall, if you really need a shield, the aforementioned Zhongli team is still much stronger. Overall Conclusion on Mono Pyro Teams\n\nPros:\n\nThe buffs and debuffs are consistent and strong enough to rival and even surpass reaction teams in output. The two most popular variants are Klee’s strongest teams. Both are highly competitive with top meta teams in the game. No need to worry about reactions. Therefore it is very beginner-friendly to play. The popular teams make full use of Klee’s kit, and accommodate her strengths, enabling a lot of fluidity, skill expression, and creativity for how long/short you want her to be on field and what actions to do. Generates a lot of Pyro Particles, alleviating energy requirements significantly. Therefore not reliant on funneling, which makes Xiangling much easier and straightforward to play than her more traditional teams. Mono Pyro can uniquely be played with two Anemo units like Kazuha and Venti. High damage, strong grouping, strong crowd control. This is straightforward. Cons:\n\nVery restricted team when facing shield breaking content. Although Anemo supports can break shields well in AoE situations, it’s still overall inefficient compared to having the “correct” elements\n\nFurthermore, content with required shield breaking often requires it for both chambers. Both Bennett and Xiangling are very useful for this content, therefore not only is your other team losing them as general damage options, but also shield breaking options. Teams are noticeably weaker without Constellations on Xiangling. Her C1 and C6 are small but contribute well to overall team damage. Her C4 is obviously huge for her personal output. Xiangling’s accuracy is very poor when enemies are thrown into Venti’s Burst. It is not recommended to play both together due to this anti-synergy. Mono Pyro compositions suffer the most from the player not having Kazuha, There are several solid substitutions but ultimately still downgrades. Therefore it is not actually that accessible. Furthermore playing both Venti and Kazuha makes the team a potentially inaccessible triple 5* comp.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"tfaB83I1x+/ZLzH4wIAdcNnm2bCDU7mZMjkg9COPjWs="},"e237efa7-02b9-4aee-9f2c-69e653d5aa54":{"id_":"e237efa7-02b9-4aee-9f2c-69e653d5aa54","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"0899216d-f29c-4235-9332-888f92662431","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"tfaB83I1x+/ZLzH4wIAdcNnm2bCDU7mZMjkg9COPjWs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8f85086b-91ec-4040-a8d3-83791560bdcb","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"xXsysVftCgYfSecPrkp6kjuFRUE4uRDIQXxWDd5oZCM="}},"text":"No shields within these specific lineups, there are alternatives but crowd control must be sacrificed with small moderate overall damage loss. ※ Burgeon (Burger) ※\n\nCore: Klee + Nahida + Hydro Hydro Options: Xingqiu/Yelan/Kokomi/Candace Sustain: Kirara/Baizhu/Zhongli/Kuki Shinobu Niche: Kazuha/Sucrose\n\nFirstly, this team composition is a great way for those wanting to play both Klee and Nahida together. Secondly, Klee has always had potential with Burgeon. 1) The blast radius of her Pyro attacks are very effective at hitting Dendro Cores to create the explosions. For easy gameplay, Klee can just spam Normal Attacks in these teams. 2) Being a catalyst user she has on-demand access to Pyro attacks. Notably, she does not require her Elemental Burst for access to Pyro attacks, as well as the Burst itself not really bringing anything key in this role. Ultimately, this means she can fully build for EM without having to worry about Energy Recharge, or similarly having to use less offensive weapons. Being an On-Field Burgeon trigger, she also has potential to benefit from various buffs that only apply to the On-Field character. 3) The potential of Sacrificial Fragments. Klee theoretically has great synergy with it, providing she had a use for its high EM substat (It is also the only weapon of the Sacrificial series to have an EM substat). What’s the synergy? Her Elemental Skill, Jumpy Dumpty generates a lot of Energy particles, provides Off-Field Pyro application, and its damage is a very big part of Klee’s kit. To balance it, the Skill cooldown is a very high 20s. Therefore, Sacrificial Fragments giving her increased Skill uses always had potential. This is also more relevant due to, in general, there not being many 4* and 5* catalysts with useful passives. As covered earlier, in fact most 5* catalysts are primarily used as stat sticks. So, a weapon option with an actual functional passive was always interesting. However, Klee never really had much use for EM, so these ideas didn’t amount to much until now.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"0BrAd8+2G5jG6i3dySamjYy187QA4Y88K3c+G5dTyAs="},"8f85086b-91ec-4040-a8d3-83791560bdcb":{"id_":"8f85086b-91ec-4040-a8d3-83791560bdcb","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e237efa7-02b9-4aee-9f2c-69e653d5aa54","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"0BrAd8+2G5jG6i3dySamjYy187QA4Y88K3c+G5dTyAs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"59597d0d-986b-490e-8eff-7c9283bc6d2b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"+/VBwPs2/cp4im1XSSO3nAJsy9rTOsXK6WazZEY+ens="}},"text":"Note: unfortunately, due to Klee building EM and neglecting ATK, DMG, Crit etc. in this role, the damage of Jumpy Dumpty is less abusable in Burgeon. 4) She also has the adaptability to heighten her amounts of Pyro application through adding in her Skill, Charge Attacks, or even Burst. Whilst less relevant for typical Burgeon consistency, this can significantly help when needing to shield break enemies, particularly enemies with Cryo shields. In comparison, an alternative character like Thoma may struggle. However, the teams have taken a while to get online, namely due to the lack of synergistic teambuilding with its release. With Burgeon explosions dealing heavy recoil damage, along with the potential for self-inflicted Burning damage, the teams have dire need for defensive utility. Burgeon also requires at least one Hydro and one Dendro teammate, severely limiting teammate options. Teammate Discussion\n\nOriginally, Kokomi was one of the few viable options. She has very strong Off-Field healing with her Elemental Skill, along with taking the Hydro applicator slot. Although she still works fine, relying on her does present many functional issues. Firstly, the range of her Skill can feel pretty restrictive, especially with the chaotic nature of Burgeon teams. It’s very easy to be fighting enemies outside of its range. This can be particularly problematic as Klee is usually already using Sacrifical Fragments for additional Skill uses herself, and not Kokomi. Secondly, since she is just being used Off-Field, the Hydro application of her Skill without being supplemented with Hydro Basic Attacks isn’t always enough. It’s very easy for enemies to just be Burning, and therefore crippling Dendro Core production and the Burgeon reactions themselves. Eventually, Baizhu and Kirara arrive and feel much more synergistic in this role. Furthermore, using Double Dendro activates Dendro Resonance giving team EM for even more Burgeon damage. The main benefit to these supports is that Xingqiu can function extremely well as an offensive Hydro teammate. His Hydro application is mobile, allowing for easy repositioning, and he has two sources with both his Burst’s Sword Rain hits and the orbiting Rain Swords from his Skill.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"xXsysVftCgYfSecPrkp6kjuFRUE4uRDIQXxWDd5oZCM="},"59597d0d-986b-490e-8eff-7c9283bc6d2b":{"id_":"59597d0d-986b-490e-8eff-7c9283bc6d2b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8f85086b-91ec-4040-a8d3-83791560bdcb","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"xXsysVftCgYfSecPrkp6kjuFRUE4uRDIQXxWDd5oZCM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"14673164-b568-4d95-9bd6-d159e2079ad5","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"NI1mCOgVv0UdBBmvN1hvJGnB03yCAkHxcCh5a+ILXuI="}},"text":"Furthermore, although his damage reduction doesn’t reduce Burgeon recoil damage, it will significantly strengthen teammate’s shields and reduce enemies actual damage. Lastly, him being a 4* character, as well as Kirara being a 4* character herself helps alot with the accessibility of Burgeon teams. Nahida is fairly critical to these teams, since her Dendro application is consistent enough to allow for some stability of Burgeon reactions. Relying on just Baizhu or Kirara will very quickly lead to instability. Nahida’s Elemental Burst also can provide significant EM to Klee. Comparing them as options, both work well with differences. Baizhu is more of a healer than a shielder, and his Elemental Burst has a long 14s duration meaning he requires less swapping into. Whereas with Kirara, her shield is very strong, but she does not contribute with Off-Field Dendro application without her C4. She also doesn’t have healing, although this isn’t much of an issue.

Klee and Nahida are together an unstoppable force of cuteness. Klee is able to fully build into EM to maximise Burgeon damage, and can benefit from Nahida’s Burst EM buffs and Baizhu’s reaction DMG buffs by being an On-Field Burgeon trigger. Can forgo investment into Klee’s talent levels. Play teams with new characters and new reactions. Importantly, these teams also value Kazuha less than older compositions. Has intrinsic access to all the hard counters for Pyro, Hydro, Electro, and Cryo shields compared to other Klee teams. Combined with Klee’s Heavy Attacks and Pyro application, these teams are very versatile for shield breaking content. Many recent Abyss blessing buffs provide incentives like increased EM or Reaction buffs when utilising Dendro teams. Cons:\n\nLiterally requires Pyro, Dendro, and Hydro teammates. Leads to restrictive team building (though ultimately not much more limiting than other playstyles). Due to the way Dendro core production and Burgeon itself scales in AoE with multiple enemies, the playstyle can see a performance dropoff in Single Target. Although recoil damage is mitigated with shields and healers, it’s still a dangerous playstyle and still requires moderate attention to avoid knockouts.

Lastly, Deathmatch can also be used perfectly due to both high damage and her Crit Rate sharing talent, Shadow Samaritan, which synergises perfectly with the incoming Klee. Reverse Melt Recommended Team Klee/Bennett/Rosaria/Kazuha\n\nTeam Description\n\nIn order to use Rosaria most effectively, it is recommended to position her order in the team rotation carefully. Since she is always recommended to combo her Elemental Skill immediately into Burst, she requires either pre-existing 2B Pyro application from Bennett immediately preceding her or ongoing Pyro application via Xiangling’s Burst or Anemo Elemental Absorption. Pay attention when played before an Anemo grouper. For example, when fighting one enemy, going from Bennett EQ > Sucrose E > Rosaria EQ would result in her Burst not Melting on the last hit, as Sucrose will reduce the aura just slightly below the threshold. However this would work if fighting multiple enemies, as Pyro aura swirled off multiple enemies maintains a strong enough foundation (and can even increase with strong swirl application from Venti or Kazuha’s Held Skill). Note, using Venti or Kazuha’s Burst applies constant Pyro anyway, so they will be more universal and easier than using Sucrose. For gearing Rosaria, Favonius Lance and Dragon’s Bane are great options, but her strongest and most flexible pick is Deathmatch. This is mainly down to her Timepiece artifact. An Energy Recharge% main stat artifact is overkill, and therefore between ATK% and EM, (with general substats) ATK% gives weaker returns due to oversaturation from Bennett’s Burst. Therefore Deathmatch with it’s high Crit Value wins due to the best balance. Whilst weaker, using Favonius Lance is equally recommended purely due to otherwise needing 140% ER+ via substats only, making gearing potentially hard. Using it, you can focus on building for all the multiple damage sources.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Q2GPKkZfmIgcmgns5GZGMFe1sIzpqGnZzofs5+6dLh8="},"89a86511-9a26-40b7-8421-d318c4776da7":{"id_":"89a86511-9a26-40b7-8421-d318c4776da7","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f003e6c3-04e6-4d01-95a8-e4ed0830af58","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"Q2GPKkZfmIgcmgns5GZGMFe1sIzpqGnZzofs5+6dLh8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"481b33e4-9368-49b0-846c-b7d4b7db4f07","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"GJf/Mhadabet8sRqPWXyaTB6rIUdtlM8S8QXiwhqNfw="}},"text":"Using it, you can focus on building for all the multiple damage sources.

Although both his grouping and energy refunding talent is highly valued to boost her performance, smaller enemies and humans who are caught flying inside his Burst can be unfortunately timed to be too high in the air at Rosaria’s Burst tick to be hit. However this is not an issue when fighting tall or heavy enemies, although at which point the grouping benefit may feel less significant. Practically, Kazuha would have the most synergy overall, as he would boost team damage and provide solid grouping. Although he does not lift enemies too high, caution must still be taken with the horizontal plane, as his Skill grouping is definitely not as tight as Venti’s, and furthermore his Kazuha Slash can throw enemies away from Rosaria’s Burst. Both Bennett and Xiangling can be played in this composition as the core Pyro support, as both of their strengths are highly valued.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"j+oaJbYAFUPeY42lTjXyUneaPkcn+myadU54B9kt+VA="},"481b33e4-9368-49b0-846c-b7d4b7db4f07":{"id_":"481b33e4-9368-49b0-846c-b7d4b7db4f07","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"89a86511-9a26-40b7-8421-d318c4776da7","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"j+oaJbYAFUPeY42lTjXyUneaPkcn+myadU54B9kt+VA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"2d16d2b8-785a-4a9c-a39e-2eef35dc1f5e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"QTNNCXm+FnHT19cHQQobZfpCknrZ5m9VesPZ78z238M="}},"text":"Furthermore, they can be played at the same time, as Bennett will significantly boost Klee’s, Xiangling’s and Rosaria’s damage output and between the three Pyro characters there is a potential surplus amount of pyro energy particles to avoid energy issues. This team is very strong if Anemo grouping is not needed. You can also double down on Cryo support, as Kaeya can be ran alongside Rosaria for Sub DPS damage. He will also drastically reduce Rosaria’s energy requirements. He does, however, come with heavy anti-synergy. Kaeya’s anti-synergy (click to expand)\nHis burst only lasts 8 seconds, which does not cover Klee’s field time. He will have to be switched in after Rosaria and before Klee. Meaning, for many compositions due to his additional cryo damage he will be removing the pyro aura and therefore weakening Rosaria’s output. His burst itself has a very small AoE (which is not even a true AoE), therefore to damage enemies he requires Klee to be hugging enemies. This has severe practicality issues with Klee’s chaotic nature and the fact that you won’t be able to run an anemo grouper in this team. Ultimately, his ICD on his Burst’s Cryo application, means unlike Rosaria he is not melting every hit rather 1/3. Therefore although they may have similar base damage modifiers, factoring in reactions Rosaria is outputting much more damage. Given Klee herself is doing strong damage too, it’s typically more efficient to use this team slot to benefit or boost these characters instead. Overall Conclusion on Reverse Melt Teams\n\nPros:\n\nConstellations on Klee provide supportive nature which benefit this team structure much more than Vaporize. Very flexible with 2 slots on the team, therefore once the core team is built up and invested in, teammates can be tailored both to suit content difficulties, as well as accounts with limited roster options. Artifact sets across the board are very versatile. Teammates including Klee can run Lavawalker, and Klee can use most of the options outlined in the earlier Artifact section to great success. Therefore it is very efficient gearing this team artifact wise. Generally has shorter and smoother rotations than vaporize teams. Apart from Xiangling, all other combinations run characters with 60 Energy Cost and 15s Cooldowns on Bursts.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"GJf/Mhadabet8sRqPWXyaTB6rIUdtlM8S8QXiwhqNfw="},"2d16d2b8-785a-4a9c-a39e-2eef35dc1f5e":{"id_":"2d16d2b8-785a-4a9c-a39e-2eef35dc1f5e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"481b33e4-9368-49b0-846c-b7d4b7db4f07","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"GJf/Mhadabet8sRqPWXyaTB6rIUdtlM8S8QXiwhqNfw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"182f0f88-369d-44bd-91da-68382b46fa46","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"pTMVkpykE0l+cCgb1c7JK5DYWVu5GeqfBnny91X8GT0="}},"text":"Strong team overall for versatile shield breaking. Teams with Pyro, Anemo, Cryo & Klee’s heavy attacks cover almost all ground. Cons:\n\nMuch more awkward to play in single-target than in AoE situations vs multiple enemies, especially when trying to utilise buffers/debuffers like Kazuha and Sucrose. Rosaria has a significant power increase at C2 with her Burst duration increasing from 8s to 12s. Depending on your other team options, not having C2 could be crippling enough to warrant looking elsewhere. Rosaria’s Burst, although having a sizable AoE, plots in a fixed position. While in general it can be manageable to contain enemies within this range, with Klee’s chaotic nature and high stagger potential, it is very awkward to play around this position without an Anemo grouper. It’s incredibly awkward to play with Sucrose if attempting to minmax. Sucrose has potential to Double VV, pass a TTDS buff to Rosaria, Elemental Burst for additional Pyro application, and EM share. However it is not possible to do these together, at least without having uncomfortable and long rotations. If played, from experience it’s recommended to just choose a few and just find the most comfortable rotation. Overall, despite its strengths, the composition can “feel” like you are just playing Mono Pyro but Rosaria is just along for the ride. In fact, the increased annoyance in having to accommodate to boost the Cryo damage and work her into your rotations can make things not worth it. If you need to play with a shielder, a valuable team slot will have to be sacrificed, more so than other teams due to the core synergies and benefits amplification and grouping can provide to them. To mitigate this loss, swapping the Anemo grouper for Zhongli is most recommended. Alternatively, a C6 Diona both shields, proves Cryo particles and a 200 EM boost whilst inside her Burst area. Her Cryo application is also relatively weak, therefore a team of Klee/Xiangling/C6 Diona/Rosaria can work well. In this team composition, Rosaria is recommended to use an ATK% Timepiece. Do note, using Diona creates another limitation on movement with an even smaller radius than Rosaria’s Burst.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"QTNNCXm+FnHT19cHQQobZfpCknrZ5m9VesPZ78z238M="},"182f0f88-369d-44bd-91da-68382b46fa46":{"id_":"182f0f88-369d-44bd-91da-68382b46fa46","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2d16d2b8-785a-4a9c-a39e-2eef35dc1f5e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"QTNNCXm+FnHT19cHQQobZfpCknrZ5m9VesPZ78z238M="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c910cf42-9c46-47fd-923a-cc928af8221e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"quPDGEsKqaQyf+Dd8OCICZ1w6Gcm0n+UD3p9mEyyyks="}},"text":"In addition, although she will substitute finely in boosting Rosaria’s damage, the increase in EM does nothing for Klee and Xiangling’s damage. ※ Overload ※\n\nOverload is a very interesting composition with Klee. For the benefit of players of all skill, combining Klee’s innate high stagger potential with Overload’s makes clearing content easier due to enemies barely being able to attack. Not to undermine its damage output, as Chevreuse as a core teammate is specifically designed to elevate a Pyro and Electro team. This creates an overall versatile playstyle as you can essentially freely mix between multiple supports depending on both your limitations and content.

This also means, especially in this team rotations should be used only as very rough guidelines, and it’s encouraged to switch off characters to parry with Beidou opportunistically.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"quPDGEsKqaQyf+Dd8OCICZ1w6Gcm0n+UD3p9mEyyyks="},"fb8059a4-f4ba-49ab-ab80-75cba553f335":{"id_":"fb8059a4-f4ba-49ab-ab80-75cba553f335","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c910cf42-9c46-47fd-923a-cc928af8221e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"quPDGEsKqaQyf+Dd8OCICZ1w6Gcm0n+UD3p9mEyyyks="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"350de666-e0d8-4e1b-b361-9c9a098aa34b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"Y+p565NauaLy/bWQQpUDAv4qG+PKYKE+zKrdvxokbGM="}},"text":"Rotation Example\n\nFirst Rotation Only Example Rotation #2 Bennett E + Q > Fischl E/Q > Beidou E + Q > Klee N1 + E + Q + E + 2N1C + 2N2C Beidou E + N1 > Bennett E > Klee N2C Repeat from Example Rotation #2 Bennett Q + E > Fischl E/Q > Beidou E + Q > Klee N1 + E + Q + 4N2C Beidou E + N1 > Bennett E > Klee N2C Repeat\n\nAlternative Characters\n\nBennett can be safely swapped out for Xingqiu. He benefits the team by preventing chaotic situations with Klee’s Pyro aura, due to her now also Vaporizing. This will allow more control, although the team’s damage will take a hit due to teammates like Klee, Fischl, Beidou and Venti not being able to take advantage of Bennett’s Burst. There is also a niche idea involving Sucrose. When she reacts on a Pyro aura, due to Viridescent Venerer’s debuff lowering this Pyro resistance, not only does this improve Klee’s damage, but this also increases overload damage for the whole team. Combined with her EM share further boosting overload damage, it is possible to build Fischl for EM damage in a team with Klee and Xiangling maintaining a Pyro aura. Due to difficulties in measuring this damage, it is hard to gauge whether fischl’s damage is overall higher with the EM build, however due to using Sucrose instead of Venti or Kazuha, we can surmise that regardless this team’s DPS isn’t the highest. Overall conclusion on Overload Teams\n\nPros:\n\nChevreuse breathes new life into this playstyle, and the upgrades can definitely be felt  in terms of playability and ease of execution. Both Fischl and Beidou don’t have skills which have limited range. Therefore there is no need to worry about attacks missing or enemies being out of range. As touched on earlier, Klee’s high stagger potential combined with Overload gives enemies little room to attack. This benefit can also be combined with Beidou’s Burst at C1, so overall this team even without huge shields from Zhongli has some of the high survivability.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"nd9EfkRSfgpH8FsF3h3z1QQkHKY7AyHnqlBcMZRbn38="},"350de666-e0d8-4e1b-b361-9c9a098aa34b":{"id_":"350de666-e0d8-4e1b-b361-9c9a098aa34b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"MG2ABn1l6nxnIKSTn07W2FLR6KhubGOcISvbB2ggQLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"fb8059a4-f4ba-49ab-ab80-75cba553f335","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"nd9EfkRSfgpH8FsF3h3z1QQkHKY7AyHnqlBcMZRbn38="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1a05426f-0281-4a12-b527-2c4187835022","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html","file_name":"Klee Guide_ Fleeing Sunlight - KQM.html"},"hash":"6ZbTBp/REw0UctVXWQ/E47r8nqUvPWIHr3Fe4Hu8Kz0="}},"text":"Fischl by herself does not require much additional energy to sustain her Burst, and Electro Resonance can generate high amounts of Electro particles too. So overall these teams do not have tough Energy requirements to meet. Cons:\n\nChevreuse is a key core teammate, and many players may not have her. Furthermore, although not required she does have powerful constellations that both increase smoothness and team damage. As with many overload teams, it can be very hard to control aura application on enemies, therefore it’s difficult to justify building much EM on characters. Fortunately, Chevreuse is arguably designed to focus more on strengthening the raw damage of these teams rather than promoting an EM focused playstyle. Although Klee’s attacks do have range, things still get hectic when combined with Overload, therefore it is almost required to be able to jump cancel between attacks to account for enemies movement. Not doing so will often leave enemies out of range. As mentioned earlier, Beidou needs higher ER% than usual due to her inability to perfect parry consistently in these teams. ※ Support ※\n\nSupport Klee Example Team Yelan/Kazuha/Klee/Flex\n\n*Note: This team is only advised for high invested players. Klee’s C2 for DEF Shred and Yelan’s C1 and Aqua Simulacra for multiple Skill uses and sufficient output is recommended as an ideal starting point. Flex options: Mona, Nilou, Venti, Zhongli\n\nTeam Gearing\n\nYelan Kazuha Klee Example: Mona Example Weapon: Aqua Simulacra Artifacts: 2pc Heart of Depth/2pc Tenacity of the Millileth or 4pc EoSF Example Weapon: Favonius Sword Xiphos’ Moonlight Artifacts: 4pc Viridescent Venerer EM/EM/EM Example Weapon: Sacrificial Fragments Artifacts: 4pc Instructor Example Weapon: Favonius Codex Artifacts: 4pc Noblesse Oblige Build as much ER% as possible\n\nOne of the most outstanding teams for highly invested accounts, this core takes advantage of stacking several multipliers to buff Yelan’s output.

Examples of stacked multipliers: Kazuha’s A4 DMG% buff, Kazuha wielding 4pc VV for RES Shred, Klee’s Jumpy Dumpty providing Pyro application for the Vaporize multiplier, C2 for DEF Shred, 4pc Instructor for EM, Mona (who is commonly used as the flex) casting her Burst for Omen’s DMG% bonus, her C1 providing a further slight increase to Vaporize. She will also activate Hydro Resonance giving extra HP% to Yelan. Players fortunate enough to have Kazuha’s C2 can also gain a significant EM buff, and A Thousand Floating Dreams on one of the Catalyst supports can also provide a small EM increase. In mobbing content, Venti with Elegy for the End can also provide an EM buff. Note: this guide does not necessarily endorse acquiring many of these buff sources. This is mostly used as an informative piece. For gearing, Klee will commonly use Sacrificial Fragments for the additional utility of multiple Skill casts. Although she can be built for damage despite mainly playing a supporting role, it’s not necessary at all. The flexibility for Pyro application meanwhile is very helpful.

Outside of triggering reactions, their raw damage is negligible. As with most characters, her Normal and Charged Attacks have different ICDs.

Nahida’s Elemental Burst creates a very large AoE field and grants buffs to Nahida’s Tri-Karma Purification and the Burst itself depending on the current elements in the party. Nahida’s Burst costs 50 Energy, a 13.5s CD and a 15s base duration; this allows her to maintain full uptime on her Burst if needed. The value of Nahida’s Elemental Burst depends largely on the team she’s being used in. There are two situations where her Burst provides notable value:\n\nIn teams where the on-field unit benefits from Nahida’s A1 EM buff. In teams with one or more Electro units, where the decrease in her Skill’s trigger interval actually makes a difference to the amount of reactions triggered. Outside of these two scenarios, her Burst does not provide much value and may not be worth using or investing in. This is compounded by her Burst’s long 1.9s cast time and its lack of direct damage or upfront Dendro application.

EM makes up the majority of her Skill’s scaling, increases Spread damage, and provides CRIT Rate and DMG% via her A4 Passive — this makes it a vital stat for her damage. In addition, she can be the unit with the most EM on a team; in such cases you should aim for 900–1000 EM to maximize her A1 buff, if the on field character benefits from it. However, Nahida can also share a team with units that are even more reliant on EM, such as certain Anemo units or Bloom triggers, in which case they may be the basis of her A1; this reduces the need for Nahida to build EM, allowing her to build other important stats like CRIT. Her weapon options may also shift her stat priorities. Lastly, EM artifacts are relatively rare and may be lacking in good substats compared to CRIT Circlets or Dendro DMG% Goblets. Ultimately, the difference between main stats isn’t very significant, so use the pieces with the best substats you have available; having 1000 EM to cap out Nahida’s A4 Passive is not mandatory to have a good build. Use tools such as the Genshin Optimizer to find specific build recommendations given your available artifacts.

Only one character on the team needs to hold this set; Nahida is often the best for this role, since she easily maintains the 4pc effect and thus allows other units (who usually deal more damage) to equip better sets. 4pc Tenacity of the Millelith Potential Best-in-Slot if the team has ATK-scaling characters who deal disproportionately more damage than Nahida (e.g., Yae Miko, Fischl), as Nahida can easily maintain its buff with 100% uptime. 4pc Golden Troupe This set is generally the best for Nahida’s personal damage, even in teams without a 4pc Deepwood holder. It is best used if another teammate is already holding 4pc Deepwood, or if she is the only party member dealing Dendro damage. This set does lose some effectiveness if she is played on-field. However, in teams with another Dendro damage dealer, such a Spread or Hyperbloom DPS, Nahida’s ability to maintain Deepwood’s 4pc effect is often preferred over maximizing her personal damage. 4pc Gilded Dreams An alternative option to Golden Troupe for maximizing Nahida’s personal damage. However, it loses value in teams where Nahida does not trigger many reactions or can only receive a portion of its EM buff. 4pc Instructor Instructor can be useful if paired with teammates who deal the majority of team damage and benefit from EM, but do not deal Dendro damage. This set requires Nahida to be on-field frequently to maintain full uptime on its effect.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"f2xGo51LsypeEtcrHYKIzpzOVUZ/yUZFcvC83XV04gE="},"7fad127e-b016-43a1-9169-27065eecaa1d":{"id_":"7fad127e-b016-43a1-9169-27065eecaa1d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Nahida Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Nahida Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Nahida Quick Guide - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Nahida Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Nahida Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"hash":"FcG55xdGeb02VfDIz5puvsGJZ0rmR1gUGZ9yOqOqyCk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1d3e136e-240a-4b74-afc9-a1f451da849d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Nahida Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Nahida Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"hash":"f2xGo51LsypeEtcrHYKIzpzOVUZ/yUZFcvC83XV04gE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"6fac7e83-c472-44b6-a401-42c8d6ee5693","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Nahida Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Nahida Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"hash":"avWSDost6f5w/Fj2Gtr2AtqU0LhGzqWGPgKsynHsTGc="}},"text":"This set requires Nahida to be on-field frequently to maintain full uptime on its effect. 2pc Mixed Sets 2pc Bonuses: EM, Dendro DMG%, Skill DMG% Mixed sets can be used while farming for a full set.

Nahida’s wide variety of teams and playstyles means each weapon’s performance is highly dependent on the specific team composition. Additionally, weapons with team utility can result in better team damage than weapons that only increase her personal damage. Nahida’s free and 4-star options are considerably strong. Additionally, her own damage output isn’t as impactful to team damage as other units’. As such, there is no need to roll weapons specifically for her outside of personal interest. Damage-Focused\n\nThese weapons serve to increase Nahida’s personal damage output. A Thousand Floating Dreams Nahida’s signature weapon and typically her Best-in-Slot for personal damage. However, it is not a massive increase compared to her other options, and other options may provide better team utility. Kagura’s Verity Competitive with Floating Dreams, particularly for on-field Nahida. CRIT Catalysts The Widsith, Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds, Solar Pearl, Sacrificial Jade, Tome of the Eternal Flow, Cashflow Supervision Various CRIT stat sticks. Each weapon’s performance is highly dependent on whether its passive can be exploited in a given playstyle. Weapons like Solar Pearl work best in on-field playstyles, while Sacrificial Jade works best for off-field. Skyward Atlas, Memory of Dust Perform similarly to CRIT weapons if Nahida is on-field and not triggering many reactions. Sacrificial Fragments Good EM stat stick, though the extra Skill use doesn’t do much since Nahida does not generate particles on cast. Magic Guide Baseline F2P option. Surprisingly good, though its effectiveness depends on maintaining Hydro or Electro aura reliably. Mappa Mare A craftable F2P option, though it only beats Magic Guide for on-field Nahida. Support-Focused\n\nThese weapons are not particularly competitive for Nahida’s personal damage, but they provide useful team buffs or utility.

This makes Burgeon teams a potent option for such scenarios, with some teams still maintaining relevant single-target damage. If an off-field Electro unit is added, Hyperbloom can be triggered between Burgeon procs. Burning can impede Dendro Core generation and should be avoided. If Nahida is used on-field, significant amounts of Hydro application are needed to match her extremely high rate of Dendro application. Due to the frequent self-damage inflicted by Burgeon, it is highly recommended to include units that provide strong healing or shielding to keep the team alive in sustained combat.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"nJS+gmGWI9atxIxnairTUANDkqYRb+jcvlc0deNV618="},"c1df9cfb-a0ab-4eb6-b6b1-c42c19878b01":{"id_":"c1df9cfb-a0ab-4eb6-b6b1-c42c19878b01","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Nahida Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Nahida Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Nahida Quick Guide - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Nahida Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Nahida Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"hash":"FcG55xdGeb02VfDIz5puvsGJZ0rmR1gUGZ9yOqOqyCk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3cf4f600-6760-4466-b553-68dca6b93e2d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Nahida Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Nahida Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"hash":"nJS+gmGWI9atxIxnairTUANDkqYRb+jcvlc0deNV618="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"33ed6489-b9b4-4394-9fa9-03c37681c189","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Nahida Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Nahida Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"hash":"SGGCas52xsJF3t9IXFQKwVZ4To9t2INg0bcYBqLSdl8="}},"text":"Notable Teammates\n\nPyro\n\nSustained Pyro appliers detonate Dendro Cores to deal AoE Burgeon damage.

Qiqi’s memory is like a sieve. Out of necessity, she always carries around a notebook in which she writes anything important that she is sure to forget later. But on her worst days, she even forgets to look at her notebook…\nOfficial Genshin Website\n\nRarity: 5-Star Element: Cryo Weapon Type: Sword\n\nIntroduction\n\nQiqi is a 5-star sword user that fills the spot of a hybrid DPS/Healer unit, being able to amplify both DMG and Healing effects via ATK stat. Her ability to deal consistent, though mediocre damage while able to apply high value of healing to the whole team makes her a great asset to her team survivability and decent DMG upkeep. Later on, her passives will even provide more opportunities for healing and higher healing values. However, it is to be noted that Qiqi has higher highs, but lower lows. In this case, Qiqi’s DMG and healing potential shared by one stat is balanced out by zero energy generation paired with long skill and burst cooldown compared to other characters. In addition, her cryo application is relatively subpar considering the cooldown times of the skills and burst (but still available to use off-field).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"9gfkF5egAry0ghzorxiEUwDzrvUp4r2wffeM2DeTJvE="},"b940b4ab-e2ca-4f85-82f7-4d0f1f02fe3c":{"id_":"b940b4ab-e2ca-4f85-82f7-4d0f1f02fe3c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html","file_name":"Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html","file_name":"Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html"},"hash":"PXcYxjixw41XACTyQa+MYvXVSs5PiuBbgqQLnnvNIFM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bc187f14-698f-4193-b6de-0c223b70ba9e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html","file_name":"Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html"},"hash":"9gfkF5egAry0ghzorxiEUwDzrvUp4r2wffeM2DeTJvE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b77a7847-7844-40a5-b37c-0fa1ec00b08b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html","file_name":"Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html"},"hash":"XdzBl9EyGoWBC31QkmM5mdJjD1ze/Mb2W1DJsANlH1w="}},"text":"Such circumstances put Qiqi at a conflicting position: where she is trying to contest against other DPS units, while seeking perfect healing opportunities with the long cooldowns. However, when scenarios work out for her, she is able to pull off clutch situations to bring the team back from ruin. Infographic\n\nPros and Cons of Qiqi\n\nPOV: You lost the 50/50\n\nQiqi is seen as an unlucky unit, the 5* to avoid at all costs. Players at 50/50 make gallows humor of rolling Qiqi instead of the banner unit. However, Qiqi does have niches where she shines, even if those are rare. Qiqi’s main benefit is that she requires little to no building to heal, and so in early game situations or in situations where you do not have a coherent team, Qiqi can stand in for an entire required role of the team. Qiqi’s main criticism is that unlike other healers, like Bennett, Diona or Jean, she doesn’t pull double duty. Other healers give utility such as 4vv, ttds, ATK buffs, cleansing, shields or batterying, while Qiqi does not appear to do anything. However, Qiqi does have decent autos, which while not that much significant damage by itself, can fill gaps in rotations, or enable on-hit abilities. Whether these benefits are as good as other healers is debatable, but they can make Qiqi more than just a benched unit. Finally, Qiqi is a very comfy character, as her heals are very strong. It is difficult to die when she is on your team. Therefore, even in situations where on paper she is a damage loss, making the player more at ease and less stressed can lead to better performance in practice, leading to cleaner clears due to less panic.

Elemental Burst\n\nBurst: Adeptus Art: Preserver of Fortune\n\nDescription\n\nQiqi releases the adeptus power sealed within her body, marking nearby opponents with a Fortune-Preserving Talisman that deals Cryo DMG. Fortune-Preserving Talisman When opponents affected by this Talisman take DMG, the character that dealt this DMG regenerates HP. Qiqi strikes nearby enemies, doing Cryo damage, and marks them with a Fortune-Preserving Talisman similar to the one applied by her A4, healing the active character whenever the marked enemy takes damage. Strengths and Weaknesses\n\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\n\nThe singular Burst hit is entirely Cryo, allowing it to be entirely Reverse Melted. The Talisman heal is also very significant, roughly 25% more potent than a heal tick from Qiqi’s Herald of Frost, and can easily carry a team back from the brink. The talisman also lingers for 15 seconds, allowing all teammates to heal themselves up even from damage that they sustained after Qiqi’s Burst has been used. Benefits certain units who lose damage from being swapped out to heal, such as Razor or Xiao, to heal up even while dealing massive damage. Qiqi’s Skill does not generate Energy and her Burst costs 80 energy. Using it consistently is impossible, even with significant Energy Recharge. This renders it impossible to utilize Qiqi’s ’s Burst in a normal sustained rotation without severe alterations to team composition. This thus forces Qiqi into a single rotation Burst damage situation if Burst support. The Burst damage is not very good when compared to other 80 cost Bursts. The animation time for the Burst is very long, often causing Qiqi’s Burst to be an overall dip in DPS when comparing to the use of the carry during that same period instead, especially when you factor in the Energy Recharge required. Qiqi’s A4 Talent also functions in the same niche this Burst does, quick and efficient healing.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"qQluaMvZL+h4RfIdFp2AKsMhvMP8AwP+MhLDltUWRbc="},"f0672d92-30b6-4648-9d8d-1d5e019a66ce":{"id_":"f0672d92-30b6-4648-9d8d-1d5e019a66ce","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html","file_name":"Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html","file_name":"Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html"},"hash":"PXcYxjixw41XACTyQa+MYvXVSs5PiuBbgqQLnnvNIFM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bc3734d0-ca6f-48fa-b2f5-f30cb6a4f072","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html","file_name":"Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html"},"hash":"qQluaMvZL+h4RfIdFp2AKsMhvMP8AwP+MhLDltUWRbc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"032ef01f-7b1c-41d3-909a-e6d662cd70aa","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html","file_name":"Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html"},"hash":"Tcqv+FpQK/vfu1vB8LJwsM7HhJc63B0fDURcWCz8qGs="}},"text":"It also requires no Energy, lower field time, and only has the singular drawback of a longer cooldown and shorter duration, neither of which is important as the Burst is difficult to produce on time and off cooldown. Her Burst Talisman healing only affects Qiqi, and does not heal her party, leaving them at risk when they have to swap on to Normal Attack. Overall, it is not ideal to factor Qiqi’s Burst into any considerations of rotation, due to multiple Energy and damage issues making it non-ideal in most scenarios. Instead, it should be considered a panic button to be used when the team is taking a significant amount of damage and both Qiqi’s skill and A4 is on cooldown.

Good to have when the healing received is simply insufficient to meet the demands, such as when you are taking massive damage. Do note that the on-field character has to trigger an Elemental Reaction to activate it, however, some on-field DPSes who does not trigger Elemental Reactions themselves will not be able to benefit from this talent. 4th Ascension Passive\n\nAscension 4 Talent: A Glimpse into Arcanum\n\nDescription\n\nWhen Qiqi hits opponents with her Normal and Charged Attacks, she has a 50% chance to apply a Fortune-Preserving Talisman to them for 6s. This effect can only occur once every 30s. This Talent is far and away the best Talent in Qiqi’s repertoire and can function in place of Qiqi’s Burst in situations that require massive healing, due to scaling identically to the mark placed on enemies by her Burst.

This Constellation is difficult to evaluate because while the Energy refund is very valuable, Qiqi’s Burst cannot be properly evaluated in normal calculations due to its massive Energy deficit and low MV causing it to be difficult to justify in most team comps. Do note that due to duration problems, when the Fortune-Preserving Talisman is generated by Qiqi’s A4, she will only benefit from 4 times of this per use of Burst and A4 together, leading to 8 Energy per use of her skill. Factoring the extended duration of the Talisman via Burst, Qiqi benefits from 9 times of C1 per Burst, for 18 Energy. Overall, Qiqi gains 26 Energy after using her Burst and two times of her Skill. This is decent for the uptime of her Burst, but given her massive range of healing abilities, it should not be needed. It is also important to note that this Constellation depends on the doubling up of healing abilities, namely Qiqi’s Talisman (requiring either her Burst or A4) and Skill at the same time. Attempting to utilize this Constellation leaves you with a massive downtime in Qiqi’s healing abilities, leading to very dangerous situations in that time unless Qiqi’s Burst is available. Do note that in these scenarios, Qiqi’s Burst would not be available as the use of Qiqi’s A4 and Skill concurrently is to generate Energy for the Burst to be available.

A useful Constellation that covers one of Qiqi’s weaknesses in utility, that her teammates can still be one-shotted even if her healing is overwhelmingly high. This Constellation not only allows units to more safely enter the field after Qiqi has used her Burst, but also allows Qiqi to provide a timeframe of relative safety for on-field DPSes using her A4.

Comps\n\nQiqi the General Healer\n\nThis is more of an emergency button build for players who need high team healing when things are getting rough.

For the cheapest option, go for prototype rancour or the flute, although any levelled weapon works. However, if you are using a set whose bonus is triggered on ‘triggering a reaction’ or ‘hitting an enemy with your skill’, Sac Sword is ideal here to supply more healing opportunities as well as having better uptime on said buffs. Alternatively, Qiqi can use Fav Sword to decrease the er requirement of teammates, directly translating to more damage. Qiqi the Superconduct Support\n\nDue to Qiqi’s long skill uptime of 15 seconds, as well as Superconduct’s long duration of 12 seconds, it is possible to extend Qiqi’s SC uptime to 27 seconds.

Furthermore, she generates cryo energy which Qiqi appreciates, if you depend on her burst a lot to cover her downtime. Kaeya: An alternative to Rosaria. Other: Any reasonably self sufficient low field time sub dps should be able to fit here reasonably well. Failing that, you could bring in any anemo unit with 4VV or any unit capable of using ttds. Artifact sets\n\nQiqi uses ATK sands, physical damage goblet and crit/crit damage circlet. Prioritise Crit rate /Crit Damage in a 1:2 ratio. Artifact Set Rationale 4 Ocean Hued Clam Qiqi gains about all the damage she would have gained from an entire rotation in one use of her skill and attacking on field, allowing her to do one more rotation of damage per rotation. The biggest tragedy is the limitation that her skill can only be used once every two rotations. Therefore, to maximise your damage, use Sac Sword when using this set. Additionally, use ATK/ATK/Heal% instead. 2 Pale Flame/2 Bloodstained Chivalry OR 4 Pale Flame Maximises Qiqi’s Physical damage from her normals. However, note that the output of this set at best is half of the above’s at incredible levels of investment, and falls off even further when considering lower levels of investment. 4 Tenacity of the Millenith OR 4 Instructors Sets to maximise Qiqi’s team contributions, in the form of buffs. Note that both sets are hindered by Qiqi’s skill uptime issues, and that even if taken care of by Sac Sword, she will still likely contribute less team damage than if she had used 4 Ocean Hued Clam. Disclaimer\n\nQiqi’s main benefit to the team is her ability to auto attack at an incredibly quick rate. Her personal damage is actually a really tiny share of the teams’, around ~10% depending on the last unit.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"fwylpVjDdnV79hgMWMpyIYuMDYwoxUk/kAa6nZM5MIM="},"697967f9-f605-4e97-b391-7dfcf52eb126":{"id_":"697967f9-f605-4e97-b391-7dfcf52eb126","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html","file_name":"Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html","file_name":"Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html"},"hash":"PXcYxjixw41XACTyQa+MYvXVSs5PiuBbgqQLnnvNIFM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f898fca5-885d-4583-bd91-7c6efe78ec50","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html","file_name":"Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html"},"hash":"fwylpVjDdnV79hgMWMpyIYuMDYwoxUk/kAa6nZM5MIM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8807088c-47a0-40da-b3d0-bc29dbc54e45","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html","file_name":"Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html"},"hash":"6qDeo9yHufz0wGkcWswrBO2yAdlf/fObIsCbGGIthIg="}},"text":"As such, the main stats and sub stats of the artifacts themselves are really not important, either because the set itself sabotages Qiqi’s damage already (4ins, 4tom), or because it is simply more resin efficient to invest into your teammates’ damage instead (4pf, 2glad2pf, 4glad). Qiqi driver’s artifacts should be the same level of priority as a support’s artifacts (that is to say, low) and the main priority should be getting the correct sets. Offsets that break set bonuses are rarely, if ever, a good idea. Weapons\n\nFrom a pure damage standpoint, here are the weapon rankings. Calcs done with 4ToM. However, Qiqi makes the comparison more difficult, as her damage is only around 15% of the team’s total damage. As such, even a jump from the effective bottom of the list to the top is only a gain of 9% total DPS. As such, the ranking of Qiqi weapons is much less concerned with the actual damage increase and more concerned with the benefits the weapon gives to Qiqi’s team. Note that this is an analysis made at a decent Qiqi investment. As such, if you use a barely built Qiqi, teammate-buffing weapons (like Sac Sword or Fav Sword) would favour your team better than personal damage increasing swords. Here are the recommendations:\n\nDisclaimer\n\nWith Ocean Hued Clam, Qiqi’s damage has been heightened significantly. However, it is also important to note that the variation across weapon have decreased significantly, when in regards to Ocean Hued Clam. As such, the only significant weapon of note in this circumstance is Sac Sword. Following that, any sword will do, although Black Sword is also pretty ideal. As such, the following lists above and below are written in the context of any Qiqi not using Ocean Hued Clam. Aquila, PJC, Summit Shaper and Mistsplitter\n\nAll very good stat sticks. While it gives Qiqi no buffing ability, its ability to increase Qiqi’s personal damage output to something halfway respectable is appreciated.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"gjv/+Xc4KgFIeTUlSzSrxnfsg2sUBs37r2we1IPCSu8="},"8807088c-47a0-40da-b3d0-bc29dbc54e45":{"id_":"8807088c-47a0-40da-b3d0-bc29dbc54e45","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html","file_name":"Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html","file_name":"Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html"},"hash":"PXcYxjixw41XACTyQa+MYvXVSs5PiuBbgqQLnnvNIFM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"697967f9-f605-4e97-b391-7dfcf52eb126","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html","file_name":"Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html"},"hash":"gjv/+Xc4KgFIeTUlSzSrxnfsg2sUBs37r2we1IPCSu8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f5565392-7bdc-48fb-84ea-286d6e8f59de","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html","file_name":"Qiqi Guide_ Icy Resurrection - KQM.html"},"hash":"mSlkxd8MHqAd5eHjCIhAvPbPEBTWz5JUaN/VxMwgxlU="}},"text":"While it would be recommended to give Aquila to a unit that can utilise it to greater effect (Bennett, for instance), it’s fine to give Aquila to Qiqi if you somehow have given something of equal worth to every unit of greater priority. Favonius Sword\n\nWhile it is the actual lowest weapon on the personal damage chart, the fact that Qiqi’s personal damage is insignificant works to its favour. Fav Sword’s generation, combined with Qiqi’s long field time, means that the passive of this sword will proc very often. As such, if you are able to adjust your team ER to the absolute minimum distribution possible with Fav Sword, this is on par with even Aquila. This makes it a highly unorthodox but effective option if played optimally. Lion’s Roar, Black Sword, Prototype Rancour\n\nThey are excellent 4* options providing good damage, although Lion’s Roar’s passive is only valid in this specific comp, and Black Sword’s healing ability is overkill. Any of these 3 are highly recommended due to being in the sweet spot of having a  low opportunity cost and high damage. Sacrificial Sword\n\nWhile also incredibly low on the personal damage chart, Sac Sword is capable of generating double the superconducts, which, in a Fischl comp, will activate double the Fischl a4s. This increases the team’s damage to an extent. Additionally, the extra heal uptime is very nice, and the increased e uptime can drastically change the optimal sets Qiqi uses, making sets such as 4tom have greater relevance even at high investments. Additionally, this is just about the best option for 4 Ocean Hued Clam Qiqi, which is in turn the best option for Qiqi in this scenario. The Flute\n\nDefinitely worse than Rancour in damage, but it comes with 20% more total ATK, even after optimization, which directly translates to more healing. Very much a comfort pick.

Look at her pink gun and say she’s not cute. You can’t. She told me to write this guide or else I’ll lose my 50/50. Learn about Sigewinne’s best builds, best weapons, best artifacts, and best teams in this quick guide. Note that the information given may change if new discoveries are made. More extensive testing is in progress. Join our Discord to participate in the theorycrafting process. New Content\n\nSilvershower Heartstrings Sigewinne’s signature weapon and one of her best Bows. Its full passive requires Sigewinne to acquire Bond of Life through her Sourcewater Droplets. Its high HP% secondary stat greatly increases Sigewinne’s own damage and her A1 Passive’s buff.

She heals and buffs the team, but loses personal damage in exchange for using less field time. Quickswap DPS\n\nOn top of her healing and buffing, Sigewinne uses her Burst to fill downtime and deal some damage. She can also hold her Skill for more damage.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ny7n6OL8kIx8wo08f22+n06B6Z3CCxIorn65KOxOSDI="},"fdb4885c-bc54-4f62-9a87-5b4527302c0c":{"id_":"fdb4885c-bc54-4f62-9a87-5b4527302c0c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"hash":"QnqvZS0Eik7QJ2baO3FX9YQiRi454ReYQVRMKbrb/gA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"90e744d7-02c9-4932-bd36-828759e9ff12","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"hash":"ny7n6OL8kIx8wo08f22+n06B6Z3CCxIorn65KOxOSDI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"172189f0-df3b-43e1-a175-c3ca3dba338d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"hash":"wlUS0hKVm47vkgdXaPQw7L+zwv46K0o+CxNkE/qf4pk="}},"text":"She can also hold her Skill for more damage. This playstyle is used in teams without a dedicated on-fielder or with some downtime in their rotations. Talents\n\nLevel and Talent Priority\n\nCharacter Level > Skill > Burst\n\nIt is heavily recommended to raise Sigewinne to Level 90 as her damage, healing, and A1 buff all scale with her Max HP.

Charged Attack Performs a more precise Aimed Shot with increased DMG. While aiming, the power of Hydro will continually accumulate on the arrow. After fully charging, Sigewinne will periodically fire slow-moving Mini-Stration Bubbles toward the target, dealing Hydro DMG. When released, an arrow imbued with torrential energy will deal Hydro DMG to the opponent hit. Plunging Attack Fires off a shower of arrows in mid-air before falling and striking the ground, dealing AoE DMG upon impact. Sigewinne has a special Charged Attack that periodically fires heart-shaped bubbles, dealing continuous Hydro damage. Despite its uniqueness, it is not particularly useful. Elemental Skill\n\nElemental Skill | Super Saturated Syringing\n\nTalent Description\n\nBlows a Bolstering Bubblebalm that can stimulate blood flow and help patients drift off to sleep using a bubblegun specially made in the Fortress of Meropide. Bolstering Bubblebalms will bounce between nearby opponents, dealing Hydro DMG based on Sigewinne’s max HP to opponents it hits. When it bounces, it will restore HP to all nearby party members except Sigewinne herself. The amount healed is based on Sigewinne’s max HP. After bouncing 5 times, the Bolstering Bubblebalm will disappear and restore HP to Sigewinne based on her max HP value. When no opponents are present, the Bolstering Bubblebalm will bounce nearby. Only one Bolstering Bubblebalm created by a Sigewinne may exist at once. When Held, the Bolstering Bubblebalm can be boosted to an even bigger size.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"rX7xfgtx8SQz2/fuyz7om662sAt+8HAfNliJHQbYFKg="},"172189f0-df3b-43e1-a175-c3ca3dba338d":{"id_":"172189f0-df3b-43e1-a175-c3ca3dba338d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"hash":"QnqvZS0Eik7QJ2baO3FX9YQiRi454ReYQVRMKbrb/gA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"fdb4885c-bc54-4f62-9a87-5b4527302c0c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"hash":"rX7xfgtx8SQz2/fuyz7om662sAt+8HAfNliJHQbYFKg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"10763d80-4066-4e89-a387-979d88b6fd68","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"hash":"cRU75kHHbQfppviqEydLM4xWrFjnzRELt38t6dR8uqo="}},"text":"When Held, the Bolstering Bubblebalm can be boosted to an even bigger size.

The Bolstering Bubblebalm will grow bigger the longer the skill is Held, until it grows up to two tiers in size. Each tier it grows increases its DMG by 5% and healing by 5%. When a Bolstering Bubblebalm bounces, it will drop down a tier in size, until it returns to being a normal Bolstering Bubblebalm. After weaker opponents are hit by big Bolstering Bubblebalms, they will be imprisoned and will be unable to move. In addition, 2 Sourcewater Droplets will be created near Sigewinne when she uses this Skill. Each Sourcewater Droplet Sigewinne collects will grant her a Bond of Life worth 10% of her Max HP. When Sigewinne’s Bond of Life is cleared, she regains 1 Elemental Energy for every 2,000 HP worth of the Bond of Life that was cleared. Sigewinne can regain up to 5 Elemental Energy in this way.

Holding Sigewinne’s Skill increases the size of the bubble by up to two additional tiers.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"wlUS0hKVm47vkgdXaPQw7L+zwv46K0o+CxNkE/qf4pk="},"10763d80-4066-4e89-a387-979d88b6fd68":{"id_":"10763d80-4066-4e89-a387-979d88b6fd68","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"hash":"QnqvZS0Eik7QJ2baO3FX9YQiRi454ReYQVRMKbrb/gA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"172189f0-df3b-43e1-a175-c3ca3dba338d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"hash":"wlUS0hKVm47vkgdXaPQw7L+zwv46K0o+CxNkE/qf4pk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"5e501a90-1b01-4a62-bbe2-524da89703b9","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"hash":"NBHvWRw0ft60E1HWnyKLsfeETWTC/RQYkfyv2qTRMjk="}},"text":"Holding Sigewinne’s Skill increases the size of the bubble by up to two additional tiers. Each tier grants increases the bubble’s damage and healing, but the bubble’s tier is reduced after each hit. This bubble still bounces the same amount of times. When smaller opponents such as Hilichurls are hit by the bigger bubble from the Hold Skill, they will be trapped until the bubble bounces again. Sigewinne generates 2 Sourcewater Droplets per Skill; these Sourcewater Droplets are identical to those created by Neuvillette and Hydro Traveler. Picking up a droplet with Sigewinne grants her 10% Bond of Life, which she can clear to receive up to 5 Energy. Elemental Burst\n\nElemental Burst | Rebound Hydrotherapy\n\nTalent Description\n\nTake out a special Fortress of Meropide-made syringe and assault the area in front with waves of kindness and medicine, dealing AoE Hydro DMG based on Sigewinne’s max HP. In addition, Sigewinne absorbs up to 2 nearby Sourcewater Droplets within a certain range right before using the skill. Sigewinne’s Burst allows her to shoot from a syringe for 2.5s, dealing 6 instances of Hydro damage and applying Hydro twice. Additionally, she collects up to 2 nearby Sourcewater Droplets when using her Burst. Sigewinne cannot be interrupted while her Burst is active, but she can jump to prematurely end its duration. Sigewinne’s Burst provides a decent burst of damage, but it does not provide buffs or healing. Thus, it is usually not worth using Sigewinne’s Burst unless the team does not have a dedicated on-fielder or needs to fill downtime. Ascension 1 Passive\n\nAscension 1 Passive | Requires Appropriate Rest\n\nTalent Description\n\nSigewinne grants herself the “Semi-Strict Bedrest” effect for 18s after using Rebound Hydrotherapy: Sigewinne gains an 8% Hydro DMG Bonus and 10 stacks of Convalescence. When the Elemental Skills of your nearby off-field party members other than Sigewinne deal DMG, consume 1 stack of Convalescence, and increase the DMG dealt by this instance of Elemental Skill DMG.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"cRU75kHHbQfppviqEydLM4xWrFjnzRELt38t6dR8uqo="},"5e501a90-1b01-4a62-bbe2-524da89703b9":{"id_":"5e501a90-1b01-4a62-bbe2-524da89703b9","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"hash":"QnqvZS0Eik7QJ2baO3FX9YQiRi454ReYQVRMKbrb/gA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"10763d80-4066-4e89-a387-979d88b6fd68","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"hash":"cRU75kHHbQfppviqEydLM4xWrFjnzRELt38t6dR8uqo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4dc394e3-b545-4cfb-98d1-76b7cb9a67cd","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"hash":"/gZhNzqzP1cL1V7kv2lIUktxdVCw5ac1xiMTlhBJDyc="}},"text":"Every 1,000 Max HP Sigewinne has above 30,000 increases the DMG by 80. The maximum DMG increase for Elemental Skills that can be gained in this way is 2,800. This passive grants a Base DMG Bonus to Sigewinne’s teammates upon using her Skill. This buff applies only to Skill damage dealt from off-field and can be activated 10 times. She needs 65,000 HP to max out this passive. Ascension 4 Passive\n\nAscension 4 Passive | Detailed Diagnosis, Thorough Treatment\n\nTalent Description\n\nWhen Sigewinne performs healing, the amount healed for this instance is increased based on the total current value of the Bonds of Life on all party members: For each 1,000 HP worth of Bonds of Life, the outgoing healing is increased by 3%. The amount of healing provided can be increased by up to 30% in this way. Sigewinne’s healing is increased by the amount of Bond of Life possessed by party members. She can gain Bond of Life herself by picking up her own Sourcewater Droplets. This passive requires 10,000 HP’s worth of Bond of Life to maximize, which means having 50,000 HP with Sigewinne considering 2 droplets. Utility Passive\n\nUtility Passive | Emergency Dose\n\nTalent Description\n\nWhile underwater, heal your active character over 2.5s when their HP falls under 50%. The amount healed is equal to 50% of their Max HP, and their All Elemental and Physical RES will be decreased by 10% for 10s. This effect can be triggered up to once every 20s. Dehya, now as a cute Melusine: Sigewinne trivializes underwater combat with automatic healing for characters under 50% HP when underwater. Constellations\n\nSigewinne’s first and second Constellations improve her buffing potential. However, her Constellations are much less impactful to team damage compared to those of her teammates (such as Furina). Her Constellation 2 is a recommended stopping point unless going for C6.

The maximum DMG increase for Elemental Skills that can be gained in this way is 3,500. You must first unlock the Passive Talent “Requires Appropriate Rest. ”\n\nOne of Sigewinne’s strongest Constellations, as it increases her buffs, healing, and damage. Sigewinne’s bubbles now bounce for an additional 3 times, and the bubble’s tier is not reduced until the 4th bounce. This greatly increases the bubble’s healing and damage, allows more bounces to trap small enemies if the Skill is held, and grants an additional instance of Hydro application. Each bubble hit also adds a stack to Sigewinne’s A1 Passive, resulting in 8 more activations per Skill. Additionally, the Base DMG Bonus provided by each stack increases by 25%, improving her buffing potential. Constellation 2\n\nConstellation 2 | “Can the Most Merciful of Spirits Defeat Its Foes? ”\n\nWhen using Rebound Hydrotherapy and Super Saturated Syringing, Sigewinne can create a Bubbly Shield worth 30% of her Max HP that absorbs Hydro DMG with 250% efficiency. The Bubbly Shield will persist until Sigewinne finishes using relevant skills. Additionally, after Rebound Hydrotherapy’s Bolstering Bubblebalm or Super Saturated Syringing hits an opponent, that opponent’s Hydro RES will be decreased by 35% for 8s.

Electro\n\nFischl Fischl contributes significant off-field damage. She quickly consumes Sigewinne’s A1 procs due to Oz, her A4, and C6 all being Skill damage.

Yoimiya Furina alone does not usually apply enough Hydro for Yoimiya to Vaporize, but Vaporize is consistent when combined with Sigewinne’s Hydro application. Other Pyro DPS Units Other Pyro units are not very synergistic with Sigewinne; they much prefer other healers like Bennett or Xianyun, or do not need Hydro application to supplement Furina’s Skill. Thoma Thoma is a reliable off-field Burgeon trigger. He also provides a strong shield when built for it.

Her Hydro application is not very high so another Hydro character is required. Furina is the best choice for the slot, but her lower Hydro application does not suffice for some DPS units. Sigewinne’s healing allows for a more offensively aligned flex character, and she can battery the second Hydro unit. Example Teams\n\nThis is not a comprehensive list of teams. The inclusion or exclusion of any given team does not necessarily reflect its power level. Sigewinne — Furina — Yoimiya — Zhongli / Yun Jin\n\nFurina’s Hydro application by itself is typically not enough to allow Yoimiya to Vaporize, but Sigewinne’s supplemental application alleviates this.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"r5ooqnmMSV+tZvjj1YDGOhuBrMKopczzRdAfyqsxTJc="},"bd00e8c1-239e-42d6-917e-d99e86260b86":{"id_":"bd00e8c1-239e-42d6-917e-d99e86260b86","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"hash":"QnqvZS0Eik7QJ2baO3FX9YQiRi454ReYQVRMKbrb/gA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2ca71fdd-4cf9-46a2-bdb5-8b3f5a209141","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"hash":"r5ooqnmMSV+tZvjj1YDGOhuBrMKopczzRdAfyqsxTJc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"9a406cfb-5d6f-4aab-bcaf-053af7d4df39","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"hash":"ATTEZWh0tBCN57mpl4wdtevpjjOuAkHYxGqyNgtUuts="}},"text":"Sigewinne’s healing stacks Fanfare and opens up flexibility in the last slot.

Quickbloom\n\nSigewinne — Electro — Dendro — Flex\n\nSigewinne is a healer option for Quickbloom teams. Her A1 Passive’s buff is useful for common characters in this archetype such as Fischl, Yae, or Nahida. Her healing allows you to run more offense-oriented Electro and Dendro characters. Due to the team’s low Hydro application, Electro and Dendro characters can easily maintain Quicken. Example Teams\n\nThis is not a comprehensive list of teams.

Freeze\n\nSigewinne — Wriothesley / Cryo — Cryo / Furina — Anemo\n\nSigewinne is outclassed by other units in Freeze teams with Ayaka and Ganyu, as her Hydro application is single-target and she lacks buffs. Nevertheless, she is still viable for being able to heal and apply Hydro. Using Sigewinne’s Burst is not recommended; that time should instead be spent batterying the Cryo DPS unit or using their attacks. Wriothesley works better than Ayaka or Ganyu due to his synergy with Furina and lack of need for a Cryo battery. Sigewinne should equip Favonius Warbow in Ayaka and Ganyu teams, since Ayaka and Ganyu are very Energy-hungry and neither Sigewinne’s personal damage nor her A1 buff are relevant in those teams. Example Teams\n\nThis is not a comprehensive list of teams. The inclusion or exclusion of any given team does not necessarily reflect its power level. Sigewinne — Wriothesley — Furina — Lynette\n\nWriothesley does not need a Cryo battery, allowing him to run both Furina and Sigewinne for their strong synergy. Lynette’s Burst prioritizes absorbing Cryo, which makes it easier to Swirl Cryo. All of this makes for a nice Fontainian-only team. The Cryo Swirl in this team is only reliable against Freezeable targets. Sample Rotation Sigewinne tE > Lynette E > Furina Q E > Wriothesley N1C > Lynette Q > Wriothesley combo\n\nSigewinne — Ayaka — Shenhe — Kazuha\n\nThis is not the most optimal Ayaka team, but it works. Sigewinne’s Hydro application is only able to Freeze consistently in single-target combat.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"4ffVvHAyn6VKVu0d/EOL4RU7Nm3wsD5D9T0wv7Hi5oE="},"dfde488d-89c3-4f1e-bfb4-db810640fb20":{"id_":"dfde488d-89c3-4f1e-bfb4-db810640fb20","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"hash":"QnqvZS0Eik7QJ2baO3FX9YQiRi454ReYQVRMKbrb/gA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"10172f0e-462e-4d2b-94f4-e4957b316741","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html","file_name":"Sigewinne Quick Guide - KQM.html"},"hash":"4ffVvHAyn6VKVu0d/EOL4RU7Nm3wsD5D9T0wv7Hi5oE="}},"text":"Sigewinne’s Hydro application is only able to Freeze consistently in single-target combat.

When it comes to 4*s, Klee can use The Widsith, Dodoco Tales and Solar Pearl. It's worth mentioning that The Widsith at refinement 5 can perform better than all other weapons mentioned Artifact Sets: Klee doesn't have too many options when it comes to what sets she can use, but depending on the team, her best in slot set varies a bit: Lavawalker(x4): This will be Klee's best in slot set in teams where Pyro aura can be maintained on the enemy, an example of this would be Klee's Monopyro team Crimson Witch of Flames(x4): In contrast with Lavawalker, this set will be best in slot for Klee in teams where she can reliably proc reactions, an example of this would be Klee's Vaporize team Crimson Witch of Flames(x2)+ ATK%(x2): This is a generalist option that will work for Klee in any team you use her, it's not far behind her x4 set options either Team One: Monopyro The core of this team is Klee-Bennett with the last two slots heavily suggested to filled by Kazuha and Xiangling.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"+n69DR0PPu5MQN36QbD5oYllrH9nB8UawCk50wMvReM="},"f8be053c-ec23-46c4-97f0-1a18063554bb":{"id_":"f8be053c-ec23-46c4-97f0-1a18063554bb","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\[3.8] Klee - best build on field-dps Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html","file_name":"[3.8] Klee - best build on field-dps Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/[3.8] Klee - best build on field-dps Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\[3.8] Klee - best build on field-dps Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html","file_name":"[3.8] Klee - best build on field-dps Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html"},"hash":"GfyB0Pq8mqpHwxdSqRf8d+VsmsJzw57SBto5AXLOe8c="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"fd1c4ff1-21be-4aef-bc36-3d5bb5238e6b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\[3.8] Klee - best build on field-dps Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html","file_name":"[3.8] Klee - best build on field-dps Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html"},"hash":"+n69DR0PPu5MQN36QbD5oYllrH9nB8UawCk50wMvReM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ff0c7eb6-3217-4799-bcef-db46157960be","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\[3.8] Klee - best build on field-dps Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html","file_name":"[3.8] Klee - best build on field-dps Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html"},"hash":"Ln7Z3TKfjrCdhibXBw/YaDNVRRR7jTXwEgMWSJ9cubc="}},"text":"If you need a shielder, Zhongli can replace either of Kazuha or Xiangling, while keeping the other in the team, Sucrose also works as an option instead of Kazuha This generally leads to a pretty big damage loss, but it can be quite difficult to play Klee without a shielder In this team your rotation should be: Klee Normal Attack> Kazuha Elemental Skill, Plunge, Elemental Burst> Bennett Elemental Burst, Skill> Xiangling Elemental Burst, Skill> Kazuha Elemental Skill, Plunge> Klee Normal Attack, Elemental Burst, Normal attack, Elemental Skill> Klee (Normal Attack, Charge Attack)x5> Bennett Elemental Skill Team Two: Vaporize The core of this team is Klee-Xingqiu-Bennett and while someone like Kazuha is viable last slot, for this team we suggest you use Yelan as her Hydro application will help Klee Vaporize more often In this team your rotation should be: Xingqiu Elemental Skill, Burst, Normal Attack> Yelan Elemental Skill, Burst, Normal Attack> Bennett Normal Attack, Elemental Skill, Burst> Klee Elemental Skill, Burst> Klee (Normal Attack, Charge Attack) until Xingqiu's Elemental Burst ends Team Three: Reverse Melt The core of this team is Klee-Rosaria-Bennett and it focuses on Klee applying Pyro for Rosaria to Melt her Elemental Burst.

Keywords Bond of Life   Party Heal   Imprisons Enemy [Infographic] Special Thanks to  @Dream traveler_en for the post:[Infographic Character Guide]#Character Guide# – 「Sigewinne」 Character Guide [Talent Analysis] Talent Priority: Elemental Skill > Elemental Burst > Normal Attack Sigewinne is deployed as a support character more often than not, so you don't need to level her Elemental Burst especially just for more DPS. Usually you'd swap her out after tossing out the healing bubble, so leveling just her Elemental Skill will suffice. Recommended Talent levels are 1/6/8 and above. 1. Normal Attack Talent Breakdown: ①       Performs up to 3 consecutive attacks. The latter two attacks will toss out pills at the target and deal Physical DMG. ②       After charging up the Charged Attack, Mini-Stration Bubbles will be generated periodically. They share Elemental Aura CD with the Charged Attack and will apply the Aura once every 2s. 2. Elemental Skill (E) Talent Breakdown: ①       When casting Elemental Skill, both Press and Hold casts will release Bolstering Bubblebalm, and will generate 2 Sourcewater Droplets on the field. ②       Each Sourcewater Droplet will grant Sigewinne a Bond of Life worth 10% of her Max HP. ③       Sigewinne regenerates 1 point of Energy per 2000 Bond of Life cleared, up to a maximum of 5 points in a single instance. ④       The Sourcewater Droplets created by the Hydro Traveler and Neuvillette can also be picked up by Sigewinne. [Key Analysis] Bolstering Bubblebalm Mechanic ①       Every 10s, Sigewinne will call down a Surging Blade on the position where Bolstering Bubblebalms hit that deals Ousia-aligned Hydro DMG based on her Max HP. ②       Bolstering Bubblebalms can bounce up to 5 times and deal Hydro DMG that scales with Sigewinne's Max HP. They apply weak Hydro Aura. ③       Each bounce provides healing to party members.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"dURmaooFeI0n3pIqnAupFvGrP7JSQJ9D6/2vaTqw0vw="},"5fcbcfab-7624-4bef-b2c8-9e5149ea0349":{"id_":"5fcbcfab-7624-4bef-b2c8-9e5149ea0349","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html","file_name":"[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html","file_name":"[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html"},"hash":"/FzCro3Yf7Ugc2KaKoNzxoOPRH1WKbjBcfbbZI+V9Ts="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ec717878-b9ab-495e-b65a-80ab6ecc1615","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html","file_name":"[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html"},"hash":"dURmaooFeI0n3pIqnAupFvGrP7JSQJ9D6/2vaTqw0vw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ae1d133c-0725-424e-886e-a05ea0b8f6bd","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html","file_name":"[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html"},"hash":"TLAN8MKXjCE9SteUj9fh+x7WRmV68FPZW0+X2SWDRpQ="}},"text":"They apply weak Hydro Aura. ③       Each bounce provides healing to party members. Only the final bounce heals Sigewinne herself. ④       The first hit of the Bubblebalm generates 4 Hydro Particles and you can only have 1 Bubblebalm on the field at all times, therefore it's not worth equipping Sacrificial Bow for the reset. ⑤       Hold cast will grant some Interruption RES and will grow the Bubblebalm up to the third level. Each level increases heal amount by 5%. ⑥       Weaker enemies will be imprisoned by level 2 and 3 Bubblebalms. 3. Elemental Burst (Q) Talent Breakdown: ①       DMG is based on Sigewinne's Max HP. The skill lasts 2.5s and deals DMG a total of 6 times, with 0.4s in between. Weak Hydro Aura is applied every 2s. ②       During cast, up to 2 nearby Sourcewater Droplets can be absorbed. 4. Passive Talents Talent Breakdown: [Passive Talent: Requires Appropriate Rest] Within 18s after casting Elemental Skill, this buff caps at 2800 (you'll need 65k HP to cap this). It serves as a DMG buff that is reflected on all off-field party members' stats and does not apply to Sigewinne. [Passive Talent: Detailed Diagnosis, Thorough Treatment] Increases heal amount based on the sum of the value of Bond of Life in the party. The more Bond of Life Sigewinne's party members have, the more healing she does. [Passive Talent: Emergency Dose] When underwater, if the current character's HP is below 50%, some percentage of HP will be regenerated over a short period. This further improves your Fontaine exploration experience. [Constellation Analysis] Constellation Quicklook Constellation Breakdown ①     C1 adds 3 more bounces to Bolstering Bubblebalm, which increases the Elemental Burst DMG buff further for off-field teammates and boosts Sigewinne's support power. ②     C2 offers the only Hydro Shield application available in the game. It also reduces enemy Hydro RES by 35%.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"yjJLo7aC+mraTBcZtbjccOwGfKKNFRbdEQ6vJqH7dWc="},"ae1d133c-0725-424e-886e-a05ea0b8f6bd":{"id_":"ae1d133c-0725-424e-886e-a05ea0b8f6bd","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html","file_name":"[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html","file_name":"[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html"},"hash":"/FzCro3Yf7Ugc2KaKoNzxoOPRH1WKbjBcfbbZI+V9Ts="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"5fcbcfab-7624-4bef-b2c8-9e5149ea0349","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html","file_name":"[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html"},"hash":"yjJLo7aC+mraTBcZtbjccOwGfKKNFRbdEQ6vJqH7dWc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1794a429-dd70-43fe-9fd1-aeff6f0fd472","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html","file_name":"[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html"},"hash":"CSqJDowFY9ZwtR/rO+Zdjs2hBy2Riho4vuU5dRd/YcE="}},"text":"It also reduces enemy Hydro RES by 35%. ③     C4 unlocks Sigewinne's Main DPS build and greatly increases Elemental Burst DMG. ④     C6 completes Sigewinne's viability as a Main DPS and greatly increases her Elemental Burst CRIT Rate/CRIT DMG, giving her considerable DPS. Constellation Conclusion Overall, C0 Sigewinne already has all she needs as a healer. If you want to improve her character utility, you can consider pulling her C1 and C2. If you want to increase Sigewinne's DPS, you can keep pulling up to her C6. [Weapon Choice] Sigewinne's key stat is HP. In order to cap the bonus effect from her Talent, we need to aim for 65k HP on her. Therefore, we'll be prioritizing HP weapons on her. The weapon fits Sigewinne's kit perfectly as it provides a lot of bonus HP as well as Elemental Burst CRIT Rate. These buffs allow Sigewinne to cap the buff from her Talent easily, boosting both her support and DPS power. Other 5-star weapon choices: Elegy for the End. Non 5-star weapon choices: Sacrificial Bow, Favonius Warbow, Recurve Bow. Additional Recommendations ① Elegy for the End increases Sigewinne's support utility and provides Elemental Mastery and ATK buffs for her party. ② Sacrificial Bow refreshes Sigewinne's Elemental Skill CD and allows her to generate 8 Hydro Particles, which helps the party's Energy Recharge needs. However, the reset won't spawn additional Bolstering Bubblebalms. ③ Favonius Warbow's Particle generation improves Elemental Burst cycle of Sigewinne's teammates. We recommend having at least 30%+ CRIT Rate on her. ④ Recurve Bow is one of the few Bows that offer HP. It will improve Sigewinne's Talent buff potency and the heal amount from her Elemental Skill. [Artifact Choices] [Artifact Choices Explanation] ①       Song of Days Past 4-piece is your BiS set given that you have her signature weapon. It increases her healing power as well as the DPS of her teammates. C0 Sigewinne's Bubblebalm lasts 9s, meaning it will trigger the set bonus of Song of Days Past twice.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"TLAN8MKXjCE9SteUj9fh+x7WRmV68FPZW0+X2SWDRpQ="},"1794a429-dd70-43fe-9fd1-aeff6f0fd472":{"id_":"1794a429-dd70-43fe-9fd1-aeff6f0fd472","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html","file_name":"[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html","file_name":"[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html"},"hash":"/FzCro3Yf7Ugc2KaKoNzxoOPRH1WKbjBcfbbZI+V9Ts="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ae1d133c-0725-424e-886e-a05ea0b8f6bd","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html","file_name":"[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html"},"hash":"TLAN8MKXjCE9SteUj9fh+x7WRmV68FPZW0+X2SWDRpQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"9f135842-efd2-4459-9055-7d94e0d121f8","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\maamo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\airtifacter\\data\\[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html","file_name":"[V4.7] Sigewinne Advanced Guide _ Mechanics_Weapon_Artifact_Team Comp Complete Analysis Genshin Impact _ HoYoLAB.html"},"hash":"xFIffxYDqe1HlsKoyodYBWEppcgHnRDkKy+IT/m/mJ4="}},"text":"C1 Sigewinne can trigger the bonus 3 times. ②       Vourukasha's Glow 2-piece + Tenacity of the Millelith 2-piece mix will provide HP Bonus and boost Sigewinne's Talent buff and Elemental Skill healing.

A: Bond of Life boosts Sigewinne's kit. She can absorb Sourcewater Droplets to gain Bond of Life and restore Energy in turn. Her healing also scales with the sum of Bond of Life value in her party. For these reasons, Sigewinne should ideally be paired with characters that can apply Bond of Life, such as Clorinde. Q2: Which enemies can be imprisoned by her Elemental Skill? A: The level 2 and 3 Bubblebalms are capable of imprisoning smaller enemies with lower Poise. Most standard enemies can be imprisoned this way, but the Electro/Pyro Kairagis, Specialist Meks, Fatui's Anemoboxer/Cryo and Hydrogunners cannot be imprisoned. Among Elite enemies, small humanoid enemies and small Elite enemies can be imprisoned. No Boss enemies can be imprisoned. [Conclusion] Sigewinne's healing kit is already complete at C0 as she can keep the whole party up with just her Elemental Skill. When you need a healer, you can always count on Sigewinne to fill in that role since she is very flexible team comp-wise. Sigewinne is easy to build and performs well even with just a 3-star weapon and 2+2 Artifact mix. Her Elemental Skill provides healing and her Elemental Burst offers DMG. She can increase off-field teammates' Elemental Skill DMG with her Talent and is overall a lovely character who can heal, DPS, and provide buffs. We highly recommend pulling her.
